# Rust CLI Rules

Use these rules for command-line applications written in Rust.
They define CLI behavior and architecture: the process boundary, arguments, streams,
exit status, terminal behavior, configuration, and destructive operations.

**Related**:

- `rust-rules` (language and API design)
- `rust-lint-format-rules` (the lint and format floor)
- `rust-project-setup` (Cargo layout, features, CI)
- `filesystem-rules`, `rust-filesystem-rules` (file mutation this CLI performs)
- `rust-testing-rules` (executable-contract tests)
- `release-engineering-rules`, `rust-release-rules` (packaging and artifacts)
- `error-handling-rules` (the full error and exit-status contract)
- `python-cli-patterns`, `typescript-cli-tool-rules` (the same contract in other
  languages)

## Keep `main` Limited to Process Setup and Exit Translation

The executable entry point should initialize process-wide concerns, parse arguments,
call domain logic, render results, and select an exit status.
Put reusable behavior in library modules.

```text
src/
├── lib.rs
├── main.rs
├── cli.rs
├── config.rs
├── error.rs
└── domain/
```

- Keep argument parser types in a CLI-facing module.
- Keep filesystem, network, and terminal adapters at boundaries.
- Do not make domain code print, exit the process, read global arguments, or depend on a
  terminal.
- For a library/CLI package, feature-gate CLI-only dependencies if library consumers do
  not need them.

## Define Arguments as a Stable Interface

Use `clap` derive by default.
It keeps the parser, generated help, value enums, and completion metadata on one typed
definition. Use another parser only when a documented binary-size, compile-time, syntax,
or compatibility constraint outweighs that shared contract.

- Make required values required in the type instead of validating an `Option` later.
- Use enums for closed value sets.
- Distinguish an omitted override from a defaulted value when configuration layers need
  that information.
- Treat `--help`, `--version`, exit codes, completion output, and invalid-input behavior
  as tested interfaces.
- Add `--non-interactive` or `--yes` only when the program actually prompts.
- Add `--dry-run` for destructive or externally visible operations when a faithful
  preview is possible.

```rust
use clap::{Parser, ValueEnum};
use std::path::PathBuf;

#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, ValueEnum)]
enum OutputFormat {
    Text,
    Json,
}

#[derive(Debug, Parser)]
struct Args {
    /// Input path; reads stdin when omitted.
    input: Option<PathBuf>,

    /// Structured output format.
    #[arg(long, value_enum, default_value_t = OutputFormat::Text)]
    format: OutputFormat,

    /// Show the planned changes without writing them.
    #[arg(long)]
    dry_run: bool,
}
```

## Write Primary Data to stdout and Diagnostics to stderr

- **Write primary data to stdout.** This includes content intended for pipes or files.
- **Write diagnostics to stderr.** Errors, warnings, progress, debug output, and status
  belong there.
- **Do not mix machine-readable data with prose.** JSON or JSON Lines mode should emit
  one documented schema and keep diagnostics on stderr.
- **Buffer high-volume output.** Lock stdout once and use `BufWriter` instead of
  repeatedly acquiring it.
- **Flush fallible output.** Propagate write and flush errors so the CLI cannot claim
  success after truncated output.
- **Test redirected streams.** A command that works only when attached to a terminal is
  not pipeline-safe.

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufWriter, Write};

fn write_lines(lines: impl IntoIterator<Item = String>) -> io::Result<()> {
    let stdout = io::stdout().lock();
    let mut output = BufWriter::new(stdout);
    for line in lines {
        writeln!(output, "{line}")?;
    }
    output.flush()
}
```

## Enable Color and Progress Only for an Appropriate Terminal

Use `std::io::IsTerminal` to decide whether interactive presentation is appropriate.

- Suppress progress animation when its stream is not a terminal.
- Respect `NO_COLOR`; support a documented `--color=auto|always|never` policy if users
  need an override.
- Keep ANSI escapes out of redirected output unless the user explicitly forces them.
- Size tables and help output for the available terminal, with a readable maximum.
- Use `PAGER` only for terminal output, and make paging opt-out and failure-safe.
- Disable prompts in CI and non-interactive modes; never wait indefinitely for input
  that cannot arrive.

Progress and status output should normally use stderr so stdout remains composable.

## Report Success Only After Every Required Operation Succeeds

Use a `run` function that returns a result and one top-level boundary that maps the
outcome to user-visible diagnostics and an exit code.

```rust
use std::process::ExitCode;

fn main() -> ExitCode {
    match run() {
        Ok(()) => ExitCode::SUCCESS,
        Err(error) => {
            eprintln!("error: {error:#}");
            ExitCode::FAILURE
        }
    }
}

fn run() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Parse arguments and perform the complete operation.
    Ok(())
}
```

- Prefer returning `ExitCode` to calling `process::exit`, which skips destructors.
- Reserve exit code 0 for complete success.
- Use stable non-zero codes for documented failure classes when automation needs to
  distinguish them.
- Preserve error causes for debug output while presenting concise default messages.
- Treat partial success as failure unless the command contract explicitly defines a
  successful partial mode.
- Handle interruption as a first-class outcome and state whether in-flight work was
  rolled back, committed, or left for recovery.

Apply `tbd guidelines error-handling-rules` for the full error contract.

## Treat Broken Pipes as Normal CLI Termination

Consumers such as `head` can close a pipe before the producer finishes.
Rust ignores SIGPIPE by default—unlike a C program—so the write returns
`ErrorKind::BrokenPipe` instead of terminating the process, and a CLI that propagates
that error unchanged prints `error: Broken pipe` when a user pipes it to `head`.

`error-handling-rules` owns the contract: an early close counts as success only at the
primary stdout renderer, only when the required work already succeeded, and never in a
way that lowers a nonzero status.
The Rust-specific point is that the conversion has to happen where the *sink* is still
known. A helper at the executable boundary sees `io::Error` and nothing else, so it
cannot tell a closed `head` from a closed socket, and mapping every `BrokenPipe` there
converts real failures into exit `0`.

Restoring default SIGPIPE behavior on Unix instead is the traditional alternative, and
it matches how other Unix tools terminate.
Take it only when the program must match that process-level behavior exactly—for example
when its exit status is consumed by a script that distinguishes signal death from a
normal exit. It needs either a small dependency or a narrowly reviewed `unsafe` signal
call; if the latter, isolate it in one function with a `// SAFETY:` argument.

```rust
use std::io::{self, Write};
use std::process::ExitCode;

/// Render to stdout. The only place a broken pipe means "the consumer has seen
/// enough", because it is the only place we know the sink is stdout.
fn render(report: &Report) -> io::Result<Outcome> {
    let mut out = io::stdout().lock();
    match write_report(&mut out, report).and_then(|()| out.flush()) {
        Ok(()) => Ok(Outcome::Complete),
        Err(error) if error.kind() == io::ErrorKind::BrokenPipe => Ok(Outcome::ConsumerLeft),
        Err(error) => Err(error),
    }
}

fn main() -> ExitCode {
    // Required work first: its failures own the exit status, and nothing downstream
    // may raise them.
    let report = match collect() {
        Ok(report) => report,
        Err(error) => {
            let _ = writeln!(io::stderr(), "error: {error}");
            return ExitCode::FAILURE;
        }
    };
    match render(&report) {
        // Either outcome is a completed run; ConsumerLeft just stopped early.
        Ok(_) => ExitCode::SUCCESS,
        Err(error) => {
            let _ = writeln!(io::stderr(), "error: {error}");
            ExitCode::FAILURE
        }
    }
}
```

Two details that are easy to lose.
`write!` on a `BufWriter` or a locked stdout can succeed while the bytes are still
buffered, so the **flush** is part of the operation being checked—omit it and the broken
pipe surfaces during drop, where nothing can classify it.
And writes to stderr in the failure path use `let _ =`: a closed stderr must not panic
and must not change the status that was already decided.

Test both a closed stdout and a closed stderr (`error-handling-rules`).

## Define One Configuration Precedence Order

Configuration precedence is documented and implemented in one place, lowest to highest:

1. built-in defaults;
2. configuration files;
3. environment variables;
4. command-line arguments.

Depart from that order only where an established convention for the domain requires it,
and say so where the precedence is documented.
Implementing it in more than one place—merging in the parser, again in a config loader,
again at the call site—is how a program ends up with two different answers for the same
setting.

- Use optional CLI fields when omission must be distinguishable from an explicit value.
- Validate the merged configuration before starting side effects.
- Report which configuration file failed and why.
- Do not silently ignore an unreadable explicitly requested file.
- Keep secret values out of debug dumps and error messages.
- Define deterministic discovery rules; avoid searching an unbounded set of parent
  directories without a documented boundary.

## Keep Logging Separate From User Output

Use a logging or tracing facade when the program needs diagnostic levels or structured
events. Libraries should not choose a global subscriber.

- Send logs to stderr or a configured sink, never the data stream.
- Make verbose and debug modes additive; they must not change results.
- Avoid formatting expensive diagnostic values unless the level is enabled.
- Redact credentials, tokens, private paths, and payloads according to policy.
- Do not treat logging an error as handling it.
  Failure must still change control flow or be an explicitly supported degraded result.

## Design Destructive Commands for Recovery

- Provide `--dry-run` when the plan can be computed without mutation.
- Summarize the exact scope before an interactive confirmation.
- Make `--yes` bypass only that confirmation, not validation.
- Prefer atomic replacement, recoverable backups, or transactions.
- Return non-zero if any requested target failed, and identify successful and failed
  targets separately.
- Make retries idempotent or detect the prior partial state and guide recovery.

Use `rust-filesystem-rules` for file mutations.

## Confine Platform Differences to Typed Boundary Modules

- Use `Path` and `PathBuf`; do not assemble paths with string separators.
- Preserve non-UTF-8 paths unless the documented interface requires Unicode.
- Make newline and encoding behavior explicit for text-processing commands.
- Test supported platforms rather than assuming Unix behavior.
- Contain platform-specific code in adapters or `cfg` modules.
- Treat signal handling, file replacement, permissions, executable suffixes, and shell
  quoting as platform contracts.
- Pass subprocess arguments as an argument vector, never a shell-composed string, unless
  shell interpretation is the feature being implemented.

## Generate Completions From the Parser

When completions are part of the supported interface, generate them from the argument
definition with `clap_complete` or the parser’s equivalent.

- Offer a command that writes a selected shell’s completion script to stdout.
- Do not write directly into a user’s shell configuration.
- Package generated completions as release artifacts when distribution channels expect
  them.
- Test that generation succeeds for every supported shell.

## Test Arguments, Streams, Exit Status, and Side Effects Through the Executable

CLI integration tests should cover:

- help, version, and invalid-argument behavior;
- stdin, stdout, stderr, files, and exit codes;
- TTY and non-TTY presentation decisions;
- broken pipes and interruption;
- text and machine-readable modes;
- configuration precedence;
- dry-run and destructive-operation failure paths;
- platform-specific path and newline behavior.

Use `rust-testing-rules` for fixture, snapshot, and property testing guidance.
