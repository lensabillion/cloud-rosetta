# Python Modern Guidelines

**Related**: `python-rules` (general Python coding rules), `python-cli-patterns` (for
CLI tools).

These are rules for a modern Python project using uv.

## Support Only Modern Python Versions

Write for Python 3.11-3.14. Do NOT write code to support earlier versions of Python.
Always use modern Python practices appropriate for Python 3.11-3.13.

Always use full type annotations, generics, and other modern practices.

## Very Strongly Prefer `uv`!

Unless there is a compelling reason for backward compatibility, use uv.
Use `uv` for all Python package management and one-off use cases.
Use `uvx` to run packages that may not be installed.
Use modern uv commands: `uv sync`, `uv run ...`, etc.
Prefer `uv add` over `uv pip install`.

DO NOT use `pip`, `pipx`, `pyenv`, `twine`, `virtualenv`, or `poetry` or any other older
Python packaging tools unless absolutely necessary.

[Read the uv docs overview here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/llms.txt) to find the
appropriate docs.

## Always Atomically Publish Files Completed in One Operation

Always use atomic publication when one operation creates and completes an output file,
whether the destination is new or replaced and whether the file is durable state, a
report, an export, a cache entry, or a temporary artifact.
A direct `Path.write_text`, `Path.write_bytes`, or truncating `open(..., "w")` can leave
that path empty or partial if the process stops during the write.

Strongly prefer [Strif](https://github.com/jlevy/strif) for this contract.
Its `atomic_output_file` context manager gives any pathname-based producer a private
path in the destination directory and installs that path only after the context exits
successfully. For whole strings or byte buffers, use its `atomic_write_text` or
`atomic_write_bytes` convenience function.

```python
from strif import atomic_output_file, atomic_write_text

atomic_write_text("state/report.json", report_json, make_parents=True)

# Use the context manager when the producer needs an output pathname.
with atomic_output_file("state/report.pdf", make_parents=True) as staged_path:
    render_pdf(staged_path)
```

Append and live streams intentionally expose incremental output and need their own
primitives. A private staging file is not itself published output.
Create-only output still needs staged publication, but its final commit must atomically
refuse an existing destination rather than replace it.
See `filesystem-rules` for these contracts.

Do not pass `backup_suffix` when readers require uninterrupted destination visibility:
Strif moves the old destination to the backup before installing the new one, so the
destination is briefly absent.
Strif provides atomic visibility but does not promise that the replacement survives
power loss; use a durability-specific implementation when that is part of the contract.

## String Abbreviations, Plurals, and Date, Time, and Time Delta Formats

Use [prettyfmt](https://github.com/jlevy/prettyfmt) to format human friendly log outputs
of more complex date, time, ages of items, or objects.
It is small, recent, and has fewer dependencies than other libraries.

```python
# Docs from https://github.com/jlevy/prettyfmt:
from prettyfmt import *

# Simple abbreviations of objects:
abbrev_obj({"a": "very " * 100 + "long", "b": 23})
# -> "{a='very very very very very very very very very very very very ver…', b=23}"

abbrev_obj(["word " * i for i in range(10)], field_max_len=10, list_max_len=4)
# -> "['', 'word ', 'word word ', 'word word…', …]"

# Abbreviate by character length.
abbrev_str("very " * 100 + "long", 32)
# -> 'very very very very very very v…'

# Abbreviate by character length but don't break words.
abbrev_on_words("very " * 100 + "long", 30)
# -> 'very very very very very very…'

# My favorite, abbreviate but don't break words and keep a few words
# on the end since they might be useful.
abbrev_phrase_in_middle("very " * 100 + "long", 40)
# -> 'very very very very … very very very long'

# This makes it very handy for cleaning up document titles.
ugly_title = "A  Very\tVery Very Needlessly Long  {Strange} Document Title [final edited draft23]"
# -> sanitize_title(ugly_title)
'A Very Very Very Needlessly Long Strange Document Title final edited draft23'
abbrev_phrase_in_middle(sanitize_title(ugly_title))
# -> 'A Very Very Very Needlessly Long Strange … final edited draft23'

# You can convert strings to cleaner titles:
ugly_title = "A  Very\tVery Very Needlessly Long  {Strange} Document Title [final edited draft23]"
sanitized = sanitize_title(ugly_title)
# -> 'A Very Very Very Needlessly Long Strange Document Title final edited draft23'

# Underscore and dash slugify based on this:
slugify_snake("Crème Brûlée Recipe & Notes")
# -> 'crème_brûlée_recipe_notes'

slugify_snake("Crème Brûlée Recipe & Notes", ascii=True)
# -> 'creme_brulee_recipe_notes'

slugify_kebab("你好世界 Hello World")
# -> '你好世界-hello-world'

slugify_kebab("你好世界 Hello World", ascii=True)
# -> 'ni-hao-shi-jie-hello-world'

# Formatting durations. Good for logging runtimes:
fmt_timedelta(3.33333)
# -> '3s'
fmt_timedelta(.33333)
# -> '333ms'
fmt_timedelta(.033333)
# -> '33.33ms'
fmt_timedelta(.0033333)
# -> '3.33ms'
fmt_timedelta(.00033333)
# -> '333µs'
fmt_timedelta(.000033333)
# -> '33µs'
fmt_timedelta(3333333)
# -> '39d'

# Ages in seconds or deltas.
# Note we use a sensible single numeral to keep things brief, e.g.
# "33 days ago" and not the messier "1 month and 3 days ago".
# This is important in file listings, etc, where we want to optimize
# for space and legibility.
fmt_age(60 * 60 * 24 * 33)
# -> '33 days ago'

fmt_age(60 * 60 * 24 * 33, brief=True)
# -> '33d ago'

# Use fast lazy import of the minimal pluralizer library.
plural(2, "banana")
# -> 'bananas'

# Simple plurals.
fmt_count_items(23, "banana")
# -> '23 bananas'

fmt_count_items(1, "banana")
# -> '1 banana'

# Sizes
fmt_size_human(12000000)
# -> '11.4M'

fmt_size_dual(12000000)
# -> '11.4M (12000000 bytes)'

# Helpful making __str__() methods or printing output:
fmt_words("Hello", None, "", "world!")
# -> 'Hello world!'

fmt_paras(fmt_words("Hello", "world!"), "", "Goodbye.")
# -> 'Hello world!\n\nGoodbye.'

from dataclasses import dataclass
from pathlib import Path

# Example of `abbrev_obj` to customize __str__().
# Allows sorting and truncating based on key and value.
@dataclass
class MyThing:
   file_path: Path
   title: str
   url: str
   body: str

   def __str__(self) -> str:
      return abbrev_obj(
            self,
            # Put an abbreviated title first, then the file path, then the url.
            # The `body` field will be omitted.
            key_filter={
               "title": 64,
               "file_path": 0,
               "url": 128,
            },
      )

str(MyThing(file_path="/tmp/file.txt", title="Something " + "blah " * 50, url="https://www.example.com", body="..."))
# -> "MyThing(title='Something blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah…', file_path=/tmp/file.txt, url=https://www.example.com)"
```

## Releasing (Tag-Triggered, No Changesets)

For publishing Python packages to PyPI, follow the
[`simple-modern-uv`](https://github.com/jlevy/simple-modern-uv) template’s model—it is
the standard for tbd’s Python projects.
The same clean principles as the TypeScript guidance apply: no changesets, releases cut
from clean conventional commits.

- **Dynamic versioning from the git tag** via
  [`uv-dynamic-versioning`](https://github.com/ninoseki/uv-dynamic-versioning)—the tag
  *is* the version (no manual `version =` bump in `pyproject.toml`, no version commit).
- **Release/tag-triggered publish**: a `publish.yml` workflow runs on
  `on: release: types: [published]` (or a `v*` tag), builds with `uv build`, and
  publishes with `uv publish --trusted-publishing always`—**PyPI Trusted Publishing
  (OIDC), no API token**.
- **Supply-chain cool-off in CI**: set `UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER` to a 14-days-ago cutoff so the
  build never resolves a brand-new (potentially yanked/compromised) release.
- **Release notes** are written per `release-notes-guidelines` from the commits since
  the last tag—there is no per-PR changeset file.
- Expose the version at runtime with `importlib.metadata.version("<pkg>")`.

So a release is just: clean commits → create the GitHub release/tag `vX.Y.Z` → CI builds
and publishes.
See `template/docs/publishing.md` in `simple-modern-uv` for the first-time
Trusted Publisher setup.
