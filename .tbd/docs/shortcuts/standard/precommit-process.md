We track work as beads using tbd.
Run `tbd prime` for more on using tbd and current status.

Instructions:

This process must be followed before committing code!

Create a to-do list with the following items then perform all of them:

1. **Confirm spec is in sync:**

   If the work has been done using a feature spec or bugfix spec (typically in
   docs/project/specs/active/) review and make any updates to the spec to be sure it is
   current with respect to the current code.

   Add any status updates to the spec to include accomplished tasks and remaining tasks,
   if any.

2. **Code review:**

   Run `tbd shortcut review-code` with scope **Uncommitted changes**.

   This performs a comprehensive review using all general and language-specific
   guidelines. Fix any issues found before proceeding.

   Additional rules to check (if applicable):
   - For Convex projects: `tbd guidelines convex-rules`
   - For backward compatibility concerns: `tbd guidelines backward-compatibility-rules`

3. **Unit testing and integration testing:**

   Run the project’s full check suite—codegen, formatting, linting, unit tests, and
   integration tests. See the project docs (e.g. CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md) for the exact
   commands.

   Then YOU MUST FIX all issues found.

4. **Review spec once more:**

   Make any updates to the spec based on the fixes or issues discovered during review
   and testing.

5. **Summarize and commit:** Summarize what was done and write a clear commit message.
   Use conventional commit prefixes: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`,
   `chore`, `plan`, `research`, `ops`, `process`. Scope is optional—only add when it
   resolves an important ambiguity.
   (See `tbd guidelines commit-conventions` for details.)
   If all checks pass, commit directly.
   Only ask the user if there are unresolved problems.
