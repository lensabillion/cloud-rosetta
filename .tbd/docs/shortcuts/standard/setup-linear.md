title: Setup Linear
description: Set up the Linear integration end to end—first-time configuration for a repository, or adding your own API key to a repository your team already configured
category: session
author: Joshua Levy (github.com/jlevy) with LLM assistance
---
Use this when a user wants to connect this repository to Linear, or says their Linear
sync “isn’t working” and you do not yet know whether the repository is configured, the
key is missing, or both.

Operate tbd for the user throughout this workflow.
Do not hand them a list of tbd commands to run.
The one deliberate exception is the secret itself: the user must enter their personal
Linear key through their local shell, secret manager, or environment settings rather
than sending it to the agent.

Two things must be true before Linear sync works, and they are set up in different
places by different people:

| What | Where it lives | Who sets it | Shared? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Configuration** — team, project, policy | `.tbd/config.yml`, committed to git | Whoever sets the repository up, once | Yes—everyone on the team gets it by cloning |
| **Credential** — `LINEAR_API_KEY` | Environment or a **gitignored** `.env` | Every person and agent, individually | **Never**—a key is personal and is never committed |

That split is the whole shape of this workflow.
A user joining a team that already uses Linear needs only the second one.

## Step 0: Make sure tbd is initialized

Run `tbd status`. If tbd is not ready, initialize or refresh it before configuring
Linear:

- If `.tbd/config.yml` is absent, ask the user for the 2–8 letter issue prefix, then run
  `tbd setup --auto --prefix=<their-prefix>`. Never guess the prefix.
- If the clone already contains `.tbd/config.yml`, run `tbd setup --auto` with no
  prefix. This installs or refreshes the local agent surfaces without changing the team’s
  issue prefix.

Do not continue until `tbd status` succeeds.

## Step 1: Find out which case you are in

Do this before anything else.
Do not edit config or ask for a key until you know which case applies.

```bash
tbd integration status --offline   # No network call: just config and credential
```

Read the output and match it:

| What `status` says | Case | What is missing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `No external tracker integrations are configured.` | **A. First-time setup** | Config and key |
| `✓ enabled: yes` and `✓ target: <KEY>`, but `✗ credential: LINEAR_API_KEY not found` | **B. Joining a configured repo** | Just your key |
| `✓ enabled`, `✓ target`, `✓ credential` | **C. Already set up** | Nothing—go to Step 4 |
| `- enabled: configured but disabled` | **D. Deliberately off** | Ask before changing it |

Case B is the common one on a team: the `integrations` block is committed, so it arrived
with the clone. **Do not re-run first-time setup in case B.** Changing `team_key` or
`project` when teammates and other agents are already syncing points this repository at
a different place than theirs.

## Step 2 (case A only): First-time setup for the repository

Skip this entirely for cases B, C, and D.

You cannot infer the team or project—**ask the user**:

- **Team key**: the prefix on their Linear issue identifiers.
  `FIN-123` means the team key is `FIN`.
- **Project** (optional but recommended): scopes both new issue creation and automatic
  inbound discovery to one project, so tbd never wanders into unrelated team work.

Then add to `.tbd/config.yml`:

```yaml
integrations:
  linear:
    enabled: true
    team_key: FIN # theirs, from the user
    project: my-project # optional; omit if they did not name one
    policy: default # open epics + anything with a live plan spec
```

Leave `policy: default` unless the user asks for something else.
It selects open epics plus anything whose `spec_path` points into `specs/active/`—the
right starting point for “track our specs and major work”.

**Size that selection before the first sync, because it is easy to underestimate.**
`spec_path` propagates from a parent bead to its descendants, so the spec clause selects
every descendant of every epic carrying a live spec.
In a spec-driven repository that can be a large share of open work rather than a small
one. Two things to check with the user when the preview looks bigger than expected:

- `tbd --dry-run integration sync --push` lists exactly which beads would be mirrored.
- Beads nested deeper than `max_nesting` (default 2) *within the selected set* are
  reported as skipped rather than created, so the number of Linear issues is normally
  smaller than the number of selected beads.
  Both numbers appear in the dry run.

**Then run `tbd setup --auto` before committing.** Writing the block leaves the
repository at whatever format it was on; setup stamps `tbd_format: f07`, which is what
stops a teammate’s pre-0.6.0 tbd from silently stripping the block on its next config
write. Commit the block and the stamp together, so no one ever clones the window between
them. If setup reports a format migration, that diff is part of this change.

Two optional keys worth mentioning only if the user raises the need:

- `user_map: { alias: person@example.com }` — the **only** identities tbd may push as
  assignees. Without it, assignees do not sync in either direction, and no email or raw
  Linear user ever enters bead data.
- `mirror_labels: true` — pushes bead labels as Linear labels.
  Off by default on purpose: a repository can carry a hundred-plus labels, and creating
  one Linear label each pollutes a shared team namespace.

This block is committed.
Commit it in the same change as any other setup, so the next teammate to clone gets it.

## Step 3 (cases A and B): Add your own API key

This step is per person and per machine.
It is the *only* step a user in case B needs.

**First, verify `.env` is gitignored — before writing anything into it.** When an
integration is configured, `status` reports either `not present and gitignored` or the
warning `not present and not gitignored`. Fix that warning before a key exists.
The Step 1 output for case A was inert and intentionally returned before printing the
`.env` finding, so check the path directly in every case:

```bash
git check-ignore -q .env && echo "safe" || echo "NOT IGNORED — fix .gitignore first"
```

If it prints `NOT IGNORED`, add `.env` to `.gitignore` and commit that **before** the
key exists on disk. This ordering is the point: it is what stops a key from being
committed.

Then have the user create a personal API key in Linear under
[**Settings > Account > Security & Access**](https://linear.app/docs/api-and-webhooks#api-keys).
Full access works; for a restricted key, enable **Read**, **Write**, **Create issues**,
and **Create comments**, and include the configured team.
If Linear does not offer personal key creation, a workspace admin may need to enable
**Settings > Administration > API > Member API keys**.

Do not ask the user to paste or send the raw key in chat.
Ask them to enter it locally through their shell, secret manager, or project environment
settings. A local gitignored `.env` at the repository root may contain:

```
LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_...
```

Rules that are not negotiable:

- **Never** ask the user to paste the raw key into chat or a command you will echo.
- **Never** echo the key, print it, paste it into a commit message or PR body, or put it
  anywhere tracked by git.
- **Never** write it into `.tbd/config.yml`—that file is committed.
- If a key was ever committed, say so plainly and tell the user to rotate it in Linear.
  Removing the commit is not enough.

tbd reads `LINEAR_API_KEY` from the process environment first, then from this working
tree’s `.env`, then from the main worktree’s `.env`. An exported environment variable is
equally fine and needs no file.

**In a linked worktree, do not create a second key.** `.env` is gitignored, so it does
not propagate to worktrees, but tbd resolves the main checkout through git and reads the
key already there. `tbd integration status` names the exact file it loaded, so a
`✓ credential` line pointing at the main checkout’s path is the expected result and not
something to fix. Write a worktree-local `.env` only to point that one worktree at a
*different* key, since it takes precedence over the main one.

## Step 4: Verify

```bash
tbd integration status   # Now with the network check
```

Every line should be `✓`, including `reachable`. If `reachable` fails, the key is wrong,
revoked, or lacks access to that team—not a tbd problem.
Have the user re-check the key and the team key.

Report the result to the user in plain terms: configured or not, which credential source
is in use (the masked form `status` prints, never the key itself), and which team and
project.

## Step 5: The first sync

**Which command depends on the case, and getting this wrong matters.**

**Case C (already set up):** stop after verification unless the user also asked to sync.
If they did, use the case B preview and full-sync sequence below.
Do not create a new key or rewrite working configuration.

**Case B (joining a configured repo that already syncs):** the links between beads and
Linear issues are stored in the beads themselves and arrived with your clone.
Run a full sync, and preview it first:

```bash
tbd --dry-run integration sync   # Preview: reconciles nothing, writes nothing
tbd sync                         # Pulls team bead state, reconciles Linear, then pushes
```

Show the preview to the user before the first write if it is not empty.
Do **not** run `integration sync --push` as a joiner.
The outbound-only path projects local bead values over the tracker without a three-way
reconcile, so it can overwrite a teammate’s Linear-side edit that a full `sync` would
have detected and reported as a conflict.
Plain `tbd sync` first pulls the current issue state from the team’s sync branch, runs
the full tracker reconciliation in place, and then publishes the resulting bead state.

If the shared config deliberately sets `integrations.sync_on_tbd_sync: false`, preserve
that team choice. In that exceptional case, run `tbd sync` first to pull the latest bead
state, preview and run `tbd integration sync` explicitly, then run `tbd sync` again to
publish the reconciled state.
Do not silently remove the override.

**Case A (first repository setup):** nothing is linked yet, so stage the initial
projection rather than creating dozens of issues in one shot:

```bash
tbd --dry-run integration sync --push              # Every bead id it would touch
tbd integration sync --push --type epic --limit 5  # A handful first
```

Have the user look at those five in Linear.
When they are happy with how it reads, widen, then switch to full sync for good:

```bash
tbd integration sync --push   # The rest of the policy's outbound set
tbd sync                      # Pull, reconcile all enabled surfaces, and push from now on
```

Runs above **20 creates** or **40 updates** refuse without `--yes`. That guard is there
because a mis-set selector turns “a couple of epics” into “every bead in the repo”.
If you hit it, re-read the dry run before adding `--yes`.

After the first sync, plain `tbd sync` includes enabled trackers automatically, so a
session-end `tbd sync` keeps Linear current with no extra command.

## Step 6 (optional): Linear’s own GitHub app

Everything above is complete without this step.
tbd’s sync needs one credential, `LINEAR_API_KEY`, and never speaks to GitHub.

Linear’s own GitHub app changes what a mirrored issue can do, not how tbd syncs.
With it installed, a pull request whose title, branch, or body names a Linear issue
(`Fixes FIN-123`) links itself to that issue, and the team’s pull request automation
moves the issue as the pull request opens, is reviewed, and merges.
Since tbd already maps a completed Linear state back onto the bead, a merge can travel
all the way to a closed bead without anyone touching either tracker.

**It sits on a different axis from tbd’s configuration:**

| Aspect | tbd’s Linear sync | Linear’s GitHub app |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | One repository | One **GitHub organization** |
| Set up by | Whoever configures the repo | A GitHub org owner |
| Credential | `LINEAR_API_KEY`, personal | None; an app installation |
| Repeat per repo? | Yes | **No** |

The scope row is the one people get wrong.
The app is installed once per GitHub organization, granting either all repositories or a
chosen subset, so a second tbd repository in the same organization needs no second
install and no second decision.
A repository administrator can install it for a single repository when org-wide access
is not wanted.

**You cannot complete this step for the user.** Installing a GitHub app is a browser
flow that ends in an org owner approving the permissions.
Linear does expose `integrationGithubConnect`, but its `code` and `installationId`
arguments are outputs of that browser flow, so there is nothing to script ahead of it.
Point the user at Linear’s [GitHub integration settings](https://linear.app/docs/github)
and let them approve it.

**Checking whether it is already installed is scriptable, and worth doing before you ask
anyone for anything.** Either side answers:

```bash
# Linear's side: an entry with service "github" means a workspace is connected
# (query { integrations { nodes { service createdAt } } } against api.linear.app/graphql)

# GitHub's side, if the user's gh token can read the org:
gh api /orgs/<org>/installations --jq '.installations[] | select(.app_slug|startswith("linear")) | {app_slug, repository_selection}'
```

A `repository_selection` of `all` means every repository in that organization is already
covered, including any repository you are about to configure.

**One warning that matters when tbd is mirroring.** The same settings page offers
**GitHub Issues sync**, which creates Linear issues from GitHub issues.
Leave it off for any team tbd mirrors into.
tbd is already an issue writer for that team, and a second writer on one issue set
produces duplicates and fights over state.
Pull request linking and issue sync are separate features; this step is only the first.

## What to tell the user when you are done

- Which case it was, and what you changed (config, `.env`, or nothing).
- That the config is committed and shared, but their key is personal and stays local.
- That `tbd sync` now covers Linear too.
- For case A: that `.tbd/config.yml` needs committing so teammates inherit it.
- Whether Linear’s GitHub app is already installed for their organization, and if it is
  not, that pull request linking is available whenever an org owner wants it.
  Say plainly that it is optional and that sync works without it.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LINEAR_API_KEY not found` | No key in env or `.env` | Step 3 |
| `.env: present and NOT gitignored` | Key is one `git add` from being committed | Add `.env` to `.gitignore` now; rotate the key if it was ever committed |
| `reachable` fails with a valid-looking key | Key revoked, missing a required permission, or no access to that team | Re-issue under Settings > Account > Security & Access; confirm permissions and `team_key` |
| Integration block vanished from `config.yml` | A pre-0.6.0 tbd rewrote config before the repository was stamped `f07` | `git checkout .tbd/config.yml`, upgrade that machine (`npm install -g get-tbd@latest`), then `tbd setup --auto` to stamp the format |
| A teammate reports “This repository requires a newer version of tbd” | Working as intended: their tbd predates `f07` and would strip the block | Have them upgrade: `npm install -g get-tbd@latest` |
| Sync says `nothing to do` but Linear looks stale | The policy does not select those beads | Check `policy.outbound` against what the user expects; `--dry-run integration sync --push` lists the selected set |
| A bead reports malformed managed-block markers | A human edited inside the `⟦tbd⟧` … `⟦/tbd⟧` region in Linear | Repair the region in Linear (one `⟦tbd⟧` and one `⟦/tbd⟧`, in that order) or delete it entirely; the next sync rewrites it |
| A reopened bead stops syncing, warning that its item is archived | Under the default `policy.archive: manual` the tracker’s archive is yours to manage | Restore the issue in Linear, or set `policy.archive: on_close` to let tbd own the lifecycle |
| Newly mirrored issues all show today’s dates | A tbd older than 0.7.0 stamped them at sync time instead of sending the bead’s own | Upgrade; dates are sent on create, so already-mirrored issues keep their original stamps |
| A pull request merged but its Linear issue did not move | Step 6 is not done, or the pull request never named the issue, or it used a non-closing word like `part of` | Confirm the app is installed for the organization, then check the pull request body for a closing word and the issue identifier |
| Duplicate Linear issues appear for the same work | GitHub Issues sync is enabled on a team tbd already mirrors into | Turn Issues sync off for that team; tbd is the issue writer there |
