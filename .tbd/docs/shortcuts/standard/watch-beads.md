Use `tbd watch` when an agent or shell process should block until committed bead state
changes. This shortcut covers the recipes.
For the command contract itself (selectors, `--since` baselines, the report format, exit
codes), see the `watch`, `changes`, and “Change reports” sections of `tbd docs`.

## Choose a Selection

Watch one static bead or a dynamic set:

```bash
tbd watch --bead proj-a7k2 --json
tbd watch --label needs-agent --json
tbd watch --spec plan-2026-07-19-bead-watch-and-external-sync.md --json
tbd watch --status blocked --json
tbd watch --ready --json
tbd watch --all --json
```

Pick the narrowest selection that still catches the work you care about.
A `--bead` watch is the right default for “tell me when this one thing moves.”
`--ready` is the right default for a worker that picks up whatever becomes available,
because it fires only on the transition into the ready set and will not re-fire while a
bead sits there. `--all` is for bridges and mirrors that must see everything.

Two habits keep a long-lived watcher honest: pass the previous report’s `tip` back as
`--since` so nothing slips through between runs, and treat exit 3 as “keep going” rather
than as failure.

## Watch, Then Spawn an Agent

This is the default unattended pattern.
It consumes no agent tokens while the remote tip is idle and catches changes that land
while the agent is working.
The pending report is durable and processed at least once: a failed worker or final sync
leaves it in place for the next start, and the checkpoint advances only after both
succeed. Use a unique `state_name` for each selection, run only one owner for that name,
and make worker actions idempotent because a crash after an external side effect can
replay the report.

```bash
set -euo pipefail

state_name=ready-worker
checkpoint_file=".tbd/${state_name}.checkpoint.tmp"
pending_file=".tbd/${state_name}.pending.tmp"
report_tmp=".tbd/${state_name}.report.$$.tmp"
checkpoint_tmp=".tbd/${state_name}.checkpoint.$$.tmp"
ready_tmp=".tbd/${state_name}.ready.$$.tmp"

cleanup() {
  rm -f "$report_tmp" "$checkpoint_tmp" "$ready_tmp"
}
trap cleanup EXIT
trap 'exit 129' HUP
trap 'exit 130' INT
trap 'exit 143' TERM

watch_once() {
  if [ -s "$checkpoint_file" ]; then
    local checkpoint
    IFS= read -r checkpoint <"$checkpoint_file"
    tbd watch --ready --json --since "$checkpoint"
  else
    tbd watch --ready --json
  fi
}

while true; do
  if [ ! -s "$pending_file" ]; then
    if watch_once >"$report_tmp"; then
      mv "$report_tmp" "$pending_file"
    else
      watch_status=$?
      rm -f "$report_tmp"
      if [ "$watch_status" -eq 3 ]; then
        continue
      fi
      exit "$watch_status"
    fi
  fi

  tip=$(node -e \
    'const fs=require("node:fs"); console.log(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(process.argv[1], "utf8")).tip)' \
    "$pending_file") || exit 1

  # A watch report is a wake signal, not permission to act on stale state.
  if ! tbd sync --pull; then
    echo "Pull failed; pending report preserved at $pending_file" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
  if ! tbd ready --json >"$ready_tmp"; then
    echo "Ready-set revalidation failed; pending report preserved at $pending_file" >&2
    exit 1
  fi

  # Choose one runner. Replace this claude command with codex exec if desired.
  if ! {
    printf '%s\n' 'WATCH REPORT (wake signal):'
    cat "$pending_file"
    printf '%s\n' 'CURRENT READY SET (after tbd sync --pull):'
    cat "$ready_tmp"
  } | claude -p \
    "Re-read current bead state before changing it. Act only if the wake still applies, make external actions idempotent, and follow the repo conventions."; then
    echo "Worker failed; pending report preserved at $pending_file" >&2
    exit 1
  fi

  if ! tbd sync; then
    echo "Final sync failed; pending report preserved at $pending_file" >&2
    exit 1
  fi

  printf '%s\n' "$tip" >"$checkpoint_tmp"
  mv "$checkpoint_tmp" "$checkpoint_file"
  rm -f "$pending_file"
done
```

The `.tmp` state files are covered by tbd’s `.tbd/.gitignore`. Inspect or remove a
preserved pending report deliberately after fixing a worker failure; deleting it drops
that wake. The example is Bash because it uses `pipefail` and function-local variables;
the executable harness also runs under the macOS system Bash 3.2.

Use the least agent permissions that can perform the intended action.
In particular, non-interactive runners need network permission before they can run
`tbd sync`; do not bypass sandboxing merely to make the example work.
A Codex worker profile that writes beads must permit the repository’s Git common
directory as well as the working tree and remote.

## Watch Inside an Agent Session

For cross-agent coordination, watch the shared bead directly.
Coordinate through bead state rather than through notes as a message log: `--notes`
replaces the whole body, so a second writer silently drops the first writer’s text (see
the `update` section of `tbd docs`). Pull before composing a replacement, and give each
writer its own child bead when several agents need a durable history.

### Claude Code

Ask Claude to run this as a background Bash task and react to its completion:

```bash
tbd watch --bead proj-a7k2 --timeout 540 --json
```

On current Claude Code, foreground Bash defaults to two minutes and can request up to
ten minutes, so 540 seconds leaves margin.
Background Bash returns a task ID and stores output for the session to read.
Newer Claude Code releases also expose a Monitor tool, which can interject when a
watched command emits output; use it when available.
Keep a bounded loop as the portable fallback because background tasks do not survive
session exit or resume.
See the official
[Claude Code tools reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference#timeout-and-output-limits).

### Codex

Prefer the watch-then-spawn pattern.
`codex exec` is designed for non-interactive pipelines, but it has no CLI wall-time
option; bound `tbd watch` itself with `--timeout` when running it inside a Codex
session. A Codex terminal process may continue through a session handle while the agent
polls it, but that is harness behavior rather than a portable wake notification.
See OpenAI’s
[Codex non-interactive mode documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/non-interactive-mode).

For an unattended runner, pin a tested profile and model instead of inheriting mutable
personal defaults. Validate that the profile can create `.git/tbd/locks/data-sync.lock`:
Codex CLI 0.135.0’s `workspace-write` sandbox denied that Git-internal write during the
Phase 1 demo even though the checkout itself was writable.
Read-only report handling still worked; bead updates required an explicitly broader
sandbox in the disposable demo environment.

## Inspect Without Waiting

When a caller already has a baseline commit and does not want to block, use `changes`
instead. It runs against the local sync branch with no network access:

```bash
tbd changes --since <commit> --all --json
```

This is the debugging tool for a watcher that behaved unexpectedly: replay the same
`since` and `tip` from its report and you get the identical report back.
