This is the **core code review** shortcut.
It performs a comprehensive review of code changes using all general and
language-specific guidelines.

It is the review *engine*: it produces findings but does not publish or fix them.
For where it sits in the PR review lifecycle (publishing reviews, addressing them), see
`tbd shortcut pr-review-workflows`.

## Scope Options

This shortcut supports three review scopes:

| Scope | What it reviews | How diff is obtained |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Uncommitted changes** | Staged + unstaged local changes | `git diff` + `git diff --cached` |
| **Branch work** | All commits ahead of target + uncommitted | `git diff <target>...HEAD` + uncommitted |
| **GitHub PR** | Changes in a pull request | `gh pr diff <PR>` |

For **GitHub PR** reviews with follow-up actions (commenting, CI checks), use
`tbd shortcut review-github-pr` instead—it wraps this shortcut and adds GitHub workflow.

## Instructions

Create a to-do list with the following items then perform all of them:

1. **Determine scope:**
   - If the user specified a scope, use it
   - If reviewing for precommit, use **Uncommitted changes**
   - If a PR number/URL was provided, use **GitHub PR**
   - Otherwise, ask the user which scope to review

2. **Get the diff:**
   - **Uncommitted changes:**
     ```bash
     git diff          # Unstaged changes
     git diff --cached # Staged changes
     ```
   - **Branch work** (default target: `origin/main`):
     ```bash
     git fetch origin main
     git diff origin/main...HEAD  # Committed changes on this branch
     git diff                     # Plus unstaged changes
     git diff --cached            # Plus staged changes
     ```
   - **GitHub PR:**
     ```bash
     REPO=$(git remote get-url origin | sed -E 's#.*/git/##; s#.*github.com[:/]##; s#\.git$##')
     gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER> --repo $REPO
     ```

3. **Identify files and languages:**

   - List the files changed
   - Note which languages are present (TypeScript, Python, etc.)

4. **Load general guidelines:**

   - Run `tbd guidelines code-review-rules` (severity vocabulary, risk ordering, and
     what makes a finding actionable)
   - Run `tbd guidelines general-coding-rules`
   - Run `tbd guidelines general-comment-rules`
   - Run `tbd guidelines error-handling-rules`
   - If reviewing test code, also run `tbd guidelines general-testing-rules`

5. **Load language-specific rules based on files changed:**

   - For TypeScript/JavaScript files:
     `tbd guidelines typescript-rules typescript-lint-format-rules`
   - For Python files: `tbd guidelines python-rules`
   - For Rust files:
     `tbd guidelines rust-rules rust-lint-format-rules rust-code-review-rules`
   - Load each language present in the diff
   - Add the topic guidelines the diff touches, in any language (full table in
     `code-review-rules`): `filesystem-rules` (paths, traversal, file mutation),
     `ci-and-gates-rules` (build config, CI, hooks, gate scripts),
     `release-engineering-rules` (artifacts, publishing, version identity),
     `supply-chain-hardening` (dependencies added or upgraded),
     `backward-compatibility-rules` (public API or persisted data shape)

6. **Perform comprehensive senior engineering review:**

   - Assess overall design, architecture, and maintainability and if there are alternate
     significantly better approaches
   - Suggest use of additional libraries or tools that are appropriate
   - Check adherence to general coding rules
   - Verify comment quality and appropriateness
   - Check error handling patterns
   - Apply language-specific best practices
   - Call out antipatterns and code smells, especially code duplication or quick hacks
   - Look for security issues (injection, XSS, etc.)

7. **Check documentation consistency:**

   - If changes affect behavior documented in specs (`docs/project/specs/active/`), note
     any needed updates
   - If changes affect the project’s development docs (e.g. `docs/development.md` or
     `docs/contexts/development.md`), note any needed updates
   - If changes affect architecture (`docs/project/architecture/`), note any needed
     updates

8. **Compile the review:**

   Write a structured review following the review artifact format in
   `tbd shortcut pr-review-workflows`—verdict, findings numbered with stable IDs and
   severities (Blocker/High/Medium/Low) and `file:line` references and a concrete
   **Fix:** suggestion each, non-blocking suggestions, false positives confirmed
   benign—so a later agent can address it.
   Add two engine-specific sections:

   - **Design assessment**: Review architecture and pros/cons/alternatives, how this
     design fits relative to other possible approaches, its strengths and weaknesses
     relative to alternatives
   - **Documentation**: Any docs that need updating

9. **Determine next action:**

   - If the user specified what to do next, follow those instructions
   - If this is a precommit review, proceed to fix any issues found
   - If this review is of a pushed PR, publishing and fixing are separate lifecycle
     stages: `tbd shortcut review-github-pr` publishes the review, and
     `tbd shortcut address-pr-review` addresses a published review
   - Otherwise, present the review and ask:
     - **Fix issues**: Create tbd beads for the findings and begin fixing
     - **Report only**: Just output the review (no changes)
