# QA Playbook: [QA Playbook Name]

Manual QA playbook for [brief description of what is being tested].

**Purpose**: [State the validation objective - what are we proving works?]

**Estimated Time**: ~[X] minutes ([breakdown if helpful])

> This is a kind of “manual test”: it is not a strict end-to-end integration test,
> because it is too costly or pass/fail is not clear.
> Goals:
> 
> - Document expected behavior that are difficult to capture fully in unit, integration,
>   or end-to-end/golden tests.
> - Make it possible for an agent to follow the instructions and evaluate if things are
>   working.
> - Make it possible for an agent to walk through and share the results with a human for
>   review as it progresses or when done.
