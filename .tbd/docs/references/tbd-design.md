## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What is tbd?

**tbd combines task management, spec-driven planning, and instant knowledge injection
for AI coding agents.**

tbd ("To Be Done" or “TypeScript Beads”) is a git-native issue tracker that stores
issues as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter on a dedicated sync branch, enabling
conflict-free collaboration without daemons or databases.
It also bundles spec-driven workflows, reusable workflow shortcuts, and a curated
knowledge base of engineering best practices that agents can inject into their context
on demand.

tbd provides **four integrated capabilities**:

1. **Task tracking (beads)**—Git-native issues, bugs, epics, and dependencies that
   persist across sessions.
   This alone is a step change in what agents can do.
2. **Spec-driven planning**—Workflows for writing specs, breaking them into issues, and
   implementing systematically.
3. **Instant knowledge injection**—25+ detailed guideline docs covering TypeScript,
   Python, Convex, monorepo architecture, TDD, and more—injected into the agent’s
   context on demand via shortcuts, guidelines, and templates.
4. **Live views and tracker sync**—A local read-only web view of bead state (§4.15),
   change watching for agents (§4.14), and synchronization with external trackers,
   starting with Linear (§8.7).

The **issue tracking layer** has four core principles:

- **Durable storage in git**—Issues are version-controlled and distributed via standard
  git
- **Works in almost any environment**—No daemon, no SQLite, no file locking issues on
  network drives
- **Simple, self-documenting CLI**—Designed for both AI agents and humans
- **Transparent internal format**—Markdown/YAML files that are debuggable and friendly
  to other tooling

Coordination and visibility build on that durable core: `tbd watch` (§4.14) wakes a
process when selected bead state changes on the remote, `tbd web` (§4.15) serves a live
read-only view, and `tbd integration` (§8.7) synchronizes beads with external trackers
such as Linear.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Drop-in replacement**: Compatible with core
  [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) CLI commands and workflows (have agents
  use `tbd` instead of `bd`)

- **Simpler architecture**: No daemon changing your `.beads` directory, no SQLite and
  associated file locking

- **Git-native**: Uses a dedicated sync branch for coordination data

- **Human-readable format**: Markdown and YAML front matter - directly viewable and
  editable in any text editor

- **File-per-entity**: Each issue is a separate `.md` file for fewer merge conflicts

- **Searchable**: Hidden worktree enables search across all issues (manual ripgrep also
  works)

- **Reliable sync**: Git-based conflict detection with field-level LWW merge and attic
  preservation

- **Cross-environment**: Works on local machines, CI, cloud sandboxes, network
  filesystems

- **Live local web view**: `tbd web` serves a loopback-only, read-only board that
  updates as local bead state changes (§4.15)

- **External tracker sync**: Optional per-repository integration mirrors or
  bidirectionally synchronizes beads with Linear; GitHub is planned (§8.7)

**Related Projects:**

- [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)—The original git-backed issue tracker tbd
  is designed to replace
- [ticket](https://github.com/wedow/ticket)—Bash-based Markdown+YAML tracker (~1900
  tickets in production)
- [git-bug](https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug)—Issues stored as git objects
- [git-issue](https://github.com/dspinellis/git-issue)—Shell-based with optional GitHub
  sync

### 1.2 When to Use tbd vs Beads

tbd and Beads serve different use cases:

**Use tbd when:**

| Scenario | Why tbd |
| --- | --- |
| Single agent, simple ticket tracking | Simpler, no daemon, fewer failure modes |
| Multi-agent with async handoffs | Git sync is sufficient, advisory claims work |
| Cloud sandbox / restricted environment | No daemon required, works with isolated git |
| Network filesystem (NFS/SMB) | No SQLite, no file locking issues |
| Need to debug sync issues | Markdown files are inspectable, no hidden state |
| Protected main branch | Sync branch architecture keeps main clean |

**Use Beads when:**

| Scenario | Why Beads |
| --- | --- |
| Multi-agent requiring atomic claim enforcement | Daemon-based sync with atomic claims |
| Complex workflow orchestration | Molecules, wisps, formulas, bonding |
| Need ephemeral work tracking | Wisps (never synced, squash to digest) |
| High-performance queries on 10K+ issues | SQLite with indexes is faster than file scan |
| Need automatic “memory decay” | AI-powered compaction of old issues |
| Need interactive edit mode | `bd edit` opens in $EDITOR |

**Key Differences Summary:**

| Aspect | tbd | Beads |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture | 2 locations (files and sync branch) | 4 locations (SQLite, JSONL, sync, main) |
| Daemon | Not required | Required for real-time sync |
| Storage | Markdown and YAML files | SQLite and JSONL |
| Coordination | Advisory claims, polling | Atomic claims, real-time |
| Workflow templates | Not supported | Molecules, wisps, protos |
| Debugging | Inspect files directly | Requires SQLite queries |

**tbd is NOT:**

- A sub-second coordination system: `tbd watch` provides poll-latency wake-ups, not
  atomic claims or push messaging

- A replacement for Beads’ advanced orchestration features (molecules, wisps, formulas)

- A workflow automation engine with templates

### 1.3 Why Replace Beads? (Architecture Comparison)

Beads proved that git-backed issue tracking works well for AI agents and humans, but its
architecture accumulated complexity:

**Beads Pain Points:**

- **4-location data sync**: SQLite → Local JSONL → Sync Branch → Main Branch

- **Daemon conflicts**: Background process fights manual git operations

- **Worktree complexity**: Special git worktree setup breaks normal git workflows

- **JSONL merge conflicts**: Single file creates conflicts on parallel issue creation

- **Debug difficulty**: Mystery state spread across SQLite, JSONL, and git branches

- **Network filesystem issues**: SQLite doesn’t work well on NFS/SMB

**tbd Solutions:**

- **2-location data**: Config on main branch, entities on sync branch

- **No daemon required**: Simple CLI tool, optional background sync

- **Hidden worktree**: Managed worktree for sync branch access (also enables manual
  ripgrep)

- **File-per-entity**: Parallel creation has zero conflicts

- **Transparent state**: Everything is inspectable Markdown files with YAML metadata

- **Network-safe**: Atomic file writes, no database locks

**Related Work:**

tbd builds on lessons from the git-native issue tracking ecosystem:

- **[ticket](https://github.com/wedow/ticket)**: An elegantly simple Beads alternative
  implemented as a single bash script (~~900 lines) with Markdown and YAML frontmatter
  storage. Ticket demonstrates that simplicity and minimal dependencies (bash and
  coreutils) can outperform complex architectures—it manages ~~1,900 tickets in
  production and provides a `migrate-beads` command for smooth transitions.
  The key insight: “You don’t need to index everything with SQLite when you have awk.”
  tbd shares this philosophy while adding TypeScript implementation, stronger conflict
  resolution, and cross-platform reliability.

- **[git-bug](https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug)**: Stores issues as git objects,
  demonstrating git-native tracking without external files

- **[git-issue](https://github.com/dspinellis/git-issue)**: Shell-based issue tracker
  with optional GitHub sync

- **[beans](https://github.com/hmans/beans)**: Another minimalist git-friendly tracker

The common thread: **simplicity, no background services, git for distribution**. tbd
builds on these proven patterns, adding multi-environment sync and conflict resolution.

### 1.4 Design Goals

Agents perform *far* better when they can track tasks reliably and stay organized.
Sometimes they can use external issue trackers (GitHub Issues, Linear, Jira), but as
Beads has shown, there is great benefit to lightweight tracking of tasks via CLI.

tbd addresses specific requirements:

| Requirement | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Works in cloud sandboxes like Claude Code Cloud | Easy setup, no daemon or SQLite, which is incompatible with some network drives |
| Git commit log noise | Issues stored on separate `tbd-sync` branch |
| Synchronized state across Git branches | Always sync from the `tbd-sync` branch |
| Git merging conflicts | One file per issue eliminates most merge conflicts |
| Agent-friendly | Self-documenting, skill-compatible, simple commands |
| Transparent formats | Issues internally are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter |
| Reliable | Clear specs, golden testing of end-to-end use scenarios |

**Design goals:**

1. **Beads CLI compatibility**: Existing workflows and scripts work with minimal changes
   for the most common beads commands

2. **No data loss**: Conflicts preserve both versions via attic mechanism

3. **Works anywhere**: Just `npm install -g get-tbd` anywhere: local dev, CI, cloud IDEs
   (Claude Code, Codespaces), network filesystems

4. **Simple architecture**: Easy to understand, debug, and maintain

5. **Performance**: <50ms for common operations on 5,000-10,000 issues

6. **Cross-platform**: macOS, Linux, Windows without platform-specific code

7. **Easy migration**: `tbd import <beads-export.jsonl>` or `tbd import --from-beads`
   converts existing Beads databases

### 1.5 Design Principles

1. **Simplicity first**: Prefer boring, well-understood approaches over clever
   optimization

2. **Files as truth**: Markdown and YAML files on disk are the canonical state

3. **Git for sync**: Standard git commands handle all distribution

4. **No required daemon**: CLI-first, background services optional

5. **Debuggable by design**: Every state change is visible in files and git history

6. **Progressive enhancement**: Core works standalone, bridges/UI are optional layers

### 1.6 Non-Goals

Explicitly deferred to future versions:

- Real-time presence/heartbeats

- Atomic claim enforcement

- GitHub bidirectional sync (external-tracker sync ships with Linear as the first
  provider; §8.7)

- Slack/Discord integration

- General TUI/GUI interfaces beyond the optional, loopback-only, read-only `tbd web`
  view (§4.15)

- Agent messaging beyond issue comments

- Workflow automation

- Time tracking

- Custom fields

**Rationale**: Ship a small, reliable core first; add complexity only when proven
necessary.

## 2. File Layer

### 2.1 Overview

The File Layer defines entity schemas and storage format using **Markdown files with
YAML front matter** - the same format used by static site generators (Jekyll, Hugo,
Astro).

**Key properties:**

- **Zod schemas are normative**: TypeScript Zod definitions are the specification

- **Human-readable**: Issues are viewable/editable in any text editor

- **Self-documenting**: Each `.md` file has YAML front matter with `type` field

- **Markdown body**: Description and notes are natural Markdown

- **Canonical serialization**: Deterministic format for content hashing

- **Atomic writes**: Write to temp file, then atomic rename (see below)

#### Markdown and YAML Front Matter Format

Issue files use the standard front matter pattern:

```markdown
---
type: is
id: is-01hx5zzkbkactav9wevgemmvrz
version: 3
kind: bug
title: Fix authentication timeout
status: in_progress
priority: 1
assignee: claude
labels:
  - backend
  - security
dependencies:
  - target: is-01hx5zzkbkbctav9wevgemmvrz
    type: blocks
parent_id: null
created_at: 2025-01-07T10:00:00Z
updated_at: 2025-01-08T14:30:00Z
created_by: alice
closed_at: null
close_reason: null
due_date: 2025-01-15T00:00:00Z
deferred_until: null
extensions: {}
---

Users are being logged out after exactly 5 minutes of inactivity.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Log in to the application
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Try to navigate to another page

## Notes

Found the issue in session.ts line 42. Working on fix.
```

**File structure:**

- `---` delimiters enclose YAML front matter

- Metadata fields in YAML (structured data)

- Body is the description (Markdown)

- `## Notes` section separates working notes from description

> **Note:** The example above shows fields in a human-friendly logical order for
> readability. Actual files use canonical serialization (alphabetical key ordering) as
> specified below.

#### Canonical Serialization

For consistent git diffs and potential future caching, we use deterministic
serialization:

**YAML front matter rules:**

- Keys sorted alphabetically at each level

- Block style for arrays/objects (no flow style)

- Arrays sorted by defined rules (labels: lexicographic, dependencies: by target)

- Timestamps in ISO8601 with Z suffix (UTC)

- Null values explicit (not omitted)

- Empty objects/arrays explicit (`extensions: {}`, `labels: []`)

- No trailing whitespace

- LF line endings (not CRLF)

**Body rules:**

- Trim leading/trailing whitespace from description and notes

- Normalize multiple blank lines to single blank line

- Single newline at end of file

- LF line endings

**Recommended `.gitattributes`:**

```
.tbd/data-sync/** text eol=lf
```

**Required `.tbd/.gitattributes`** (created by `tbd setup`):

```gitattributes
# Protect ID mappings from merge deletion (always keep all rows)
# See: https://github.com/jlevy/tbd/issues/99
**/mappings/ids.yml merge=union
```

> **Why `merge=union`?** Git 3-way merge can delete `ids.yml` when merging a feature
> branch back to main, because main has no outbox directory and the merge treats “no
> file” as the correct state.
> The `merge=union` strategy keeps all lines from both sides, which is safe for
> `ids.yml` since it’s an append-only mapping.
> Contested duplicate keys (same short ID mapped to different ULIDs) are resolved
> deterministically at load time: the lexicographically smallest ULID keeps the
> contested short ID, and each displaced ULID receives a replacement derived from its
> own characters (no randomness).
> The corrected mapping is written on next save.
> This file is placed inside `.tbd/` so all tbd settings are self-contained in one
> directory. Git supports `.gitattributes` in subdirectories with paths relative to that
> directory.

> **Why canonical format?** Deterministic serialization ensures:
> 
> 1. Git diffs show only actual content changes (no spurious whitespace/ordering noise)
> 2. Testing is reliable (same input produces same output)
> 3. Future caching/deduplication can use content hashes if needed

#### Atomic File Writes

All file writes MUST be atomic to prevent corruption from crashes or concurrent access:

```typescript
async function atomicWrite(path: string, content: string): Promise<void> {
  const tmpPath = `${path}.tmp.${process.pid}.${Date.now()}`;

  // Write to temporary file
  await fs.writeFile(tmpPath, content, 'utf8');

  // Ensure data is on disk
  const fd = await fs.open(tmpPath, 'r');
  await fd.sync();
  await fd.close();

  // Atomic rename (POSIX guarantees atomicity)
  await fs.rename(tmpPath, path);
}
```

**Why atomic writes?**

- Prevents half-written files if process crashes mid-write

- Prevents readers from seeing incomplete content

- Works on most filesystems (POSIX rename is atomic)

- Important on network filesystems

**Cross-platform notes:**

- POSIX local filesystems: `rename()` is atomic and durable after `fsync()`

- Windows: `rename()` is atomic but may fail if target exists (use `MoveFileEx` with
  `MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING`)

- Network filesystems (NFS, SMB): Best-effort atomicity; may not be fully atomic but
  still prevents partial writes

- Implementations should use a well-tested atomic-write library when available

**Cleanup:** On startup, remove orphaned `.tmp.*` files in tbd directories that are
**older than 1 hour**. This threshold prevents race conditions where one process creates
a temp file while another is cleaning up.
Alternatively, include `node_id` in temp file names and only cleanup files matching the
current node’s prefix.

### 2.2 Directory Structure

tbd uses four directory locations:

- **`.tbd/`** on main branch: Configuration (tracked) + installed docs (gitignored)

- **`$GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/`** local repo-scoped machinery shared by the main checkout and
  all linked worktrees

- **`$GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/data-sync-worktree/`** hidden worktree: Checkout of `tbd-sync`
  branch for search and writes

- **`.tbd/data-sync/`** on `tbd-sync` branch: Synced entities and attic payload

> **Future: Simple Mode**—For users who don’t need multi-machine sync, tbd could support
> a “simple mode” where `data-sync/` is committed directly to main instead of using a
> worktree. This would be enabled by removing `data-sync` from `.tbd/.gitignore`. Not
> implemented in V1, but the naming structure supports this future option.

**Why this structure?**

- Config on main versions with your code

- Synced data on separate branch avoids merge conflicts on working branches

- Local docs and state are gitignored, never synced

- File-per-entity enables parallel operations without conflicts

- **Hidden worktree enables fast search** via ripgrep/grep

### 2.3 Hidden Worktree Model

tbd maintains one **hidden git worktree** at `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/data-sync-worktree/`
that checks out the `tbd-sync` branch.
The Git common-dir location is shared by the main checkout and linked worktrees, so
Codex or other agents can run from any checkout without creating competing `tbd-sync`
worktrees. This provides:

1. **Fast search**: ripgrep can search all issues without git plumbing commands

2. **Direct file access**: Read issues without `git show` overhead

3. **Isolated from main**: Doesn’t pollute working directory or affect main branch

4. **Automatic updates**: Updated on `tbd sync` operations

5. **Linked-worktree safety**: One shared sync worktree owns `tbd-sync`, and a
   repo-scoped mkdir lock serializes mutations

#### Worktree Setup

Created automatically by `tbd init` or first `tbd sync`:

```bash
# Create hidden worktree (done by tbd internally)
git worktree add "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)/tbd/data-sync-worktree" tbd-sync

# Or if tbd-sync doesn't exist yet
git worktree add --orphan -b tbd-sync "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)/tbd/data-sync-worktree"
```

**Key properties:**

- **Attached to sync branch**: Worktree is checked out to `tbd-sync` branch so commits
  update the branch ref.
  This ensures `git push` operations can detect new commits.
  If the worktree becomes detached (from old tbd versions), it’s automatically repaired
  before commits.

- **Hidden location**: Inside Git’s common directory, not inside any single checkout

- **Safe updates**: `tbd sync` acquires `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/locks/data-sync.lock/`
  before mutating the worktree, committing, fetching, merging, or pushing.
  The lock carries a unique owner token, heartbeats while live, and is removed only by
  that owner, so stale-lock recovery cannot make an old holder delete its successor.

#### Worktree Gitignore

The `.tbd/.gitignore` must include:

```gitignore
# Installed documentation (regenerated on setup)
docs/

# Hidden worktree for tbd-sync branch
data-sync-worktree/

# Data sync directory (only exists in worktree)
data-sync/

# Local state
state.yml

# Local backups (corrupted worktrees, migrated data)
backups/

# workspaces/ stores state (including outbox) committed to the working branch
!workspaces/
```

> **Note:** `data-sync/` is gitignored to support potential future “simple mode” where
> issues could be stored directly on main without a worktree.
> In normal operation, `data-sync/` only exists inside the worktree checkout.
> 
> **Note:** Production repair and migration backups under the shared common-dir layout
> live at `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/backups/`, alongside `layout.yml` and the shared
> `data-sync-worktree/`. The legacy `.tbd/backups/` directory on the main branch is
> gitignored and reserved for historical local backups; current `tbd doctor --fix` and
> migration paths write to the common-dir location.
> Both differ from `.tbd/data-sync/attic/` on the sync branch which stores merge
> conflict losers.
> 
> **Note:** `workspaces/` must not be gitignored—it stores outbox data that must be
> committed to the working branch.

#### .tbd/.gitattributes Contents

The `.tbd/.gitattributes` file configures merge strategies for tbd files.
It is placed inside `.tbd/` (not at the repo root) so all tbd settings are
self-contained. Git supports `.gitattributes` in subdirectories with paths relative to
that directory.

```gitattributes
# Protect ID mappings from merge deletion (always keep all rows)
# See: https://github.com/jlevy/tbd/issues/99
**/mappings/ids.yml merge=union
```

> **Why this is needed:** When a feature branch with outbox changes is merged back to
> main (which has no outbox), git’s 3-way merge can delete `ids.yml` entirely—treating
> “no file” on main as the correct state.
> This causes all tbd commands to crash with “No short ID mapping found”.
> The `merge=union` built-in merge driver keeps all lines from both sides, preventing
> row deletion. Duplicate YAML keys (if any) are tolerated by the parser and auto-fixed
> on next save. See [#99](https://github.com/jlevy/tbd/issues/99) for details.

#### Accessing Issues via Worktree

```bash
WORKTREE="$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)/tbd/data-sync-worktree"

# Files are directly accessible
cat "$WORKTREE/.tbd/data-sync/issues/is-a1b2c3.md"

# ripgrep search across all issues
rg "authentication" "$WORKTREE/.tbd/data-sync/issues/"

# List all issues
ls "$WORKTREE/.tbd/data-sync/issues/"
```

#### Worktree Lifecycle

| Operation | Worktree Action |
| --- | --- |
| `tbd init` | Create worktree if tbd-sync exists |
| `tbd sync --pull` | Fetch and merge through the shared worktree |
| `tbd sync --push` | Update worktree after successful push |
| `tbd doctor` | Verify worktree health, repair if needed |
| Repo clone | Worktree created on first tbd command |

**Invariant:** The hidden worktree at `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/data-sync-worktree/` always
reflects the current state of the `tbd-sync` branch after sync operations.

#### Worktree Initialization Decision Tree

When any `tbd` command runs, it must ensure the worktree is initialized.
The logic depends on the repository state:

```
START: Any tbd command
    │
    ├─ Does .tbd/ directory exist?
    │   ├─ NO → Run `tbd init` first (error: "Not a tbd repository")
    │   └─ YES ↓
    │
    ├─ Does $GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/data-sync-worktree/ exist and contain valid checkout?
    │   ├─ YES → Worktree ready, proceed with command
    │   └─ NO ↓
    │
    ├─ Does tbd-sync branch exist (local or remote)?
    │   ├─ YES (local) → git worktree add $GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/data-sync-worktree tbd-sync
    │   ├─ YES (remote only) → git fetch origin tbd-sync
    │   │                      git worktree add $GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/data-sync-worktree tbd-sync
    │   └─ NO → This is a fresh tbd init, create orphan worktree:
    │           git worktree add --orphan -b tbd-sync $GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/data-sync-worktree
    │           (Initialize .tbd/data-sync/ structure in worktree)
    │
    └─ Worktree ready, proceed with command
```

**Scenarios:**

| Repository State | Worktree Action |
| --- | --- |
| Fresh `tbd init` | Create orphan worktree with empty .tbd/data-sync/ |
| Clone of existing tbd repo | Fetch remote, create worktree from origin/tbd-sync |
| Existing local worktree corrupted | `tbd doctor --fix` removes and recreates |
| Worktree exists but stale | `tbd sync` updates to latest commit |

#### Worktree Health States

The worktree can be in one of four states, detected by `checkWorktreeHealth()`:

| State | Description | Detection | Recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `valid` | Healthy, ready to use | Directory exists, `.git` file valid, not prunable | None needed |
| `missing` | Directory doesn’t exist | `!exists($GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/data-sync-worktree/)` | Create from local or remote branch |
| `prunable` | Directory deleted but git still tracks it | `git worktree list --porcelain` shows prunable | `git worktree prune`, then recreate |
| `corrupted` | Directory exists but invalid | Missing `.git` file, invalid gitdir pointer, or wrong branch | **Backup to $GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/backups/**, then recreate |

**Safety: Backup before removal**

A corrupted worktree may still contain uncommitted issue data.
Before removing, ALWAYS back it up to prevent data loss:

```bash
# Backup corrupted worktree before removal
COMMON="$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)"
mv "$COMMON/tbd/data-sync-worktree" "$COMMON/tbd/backups/corrupted-worktree-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
```

The backup is placed in `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/backups/`, preserving the data for manual
recovery while not polluting the repository.

**Detection algorithm:**

```typescript
async function checkWorktreeHealth(baseDir: string): Promise<{
  healthy: boolean;
  status: 'valid' | 'missing' | 'prunable' | 'corrupted';
  details?: string;
}> {
  const { sharedWorktreePath: worktreePath } = await resolveSharedTbdPaths(baseDir);

  // Check directory exists
  if (!(await pathExists(worktreePath))) {
    return { healthy: false, status: 'missing' };
  }

  // Check .git file exists and is valid
  const gitFile = join(worktreePath, '.git');
  if (!(await pathExists(gitFile))) {
    return { healthy: false, status: 'corrupted', details: 'Missing .git file' };
  }

  // Check git worktree list for prunable status
  const worktreeList = await git('worktree', 'list', '--porcelain');
  if (worktreeList.includes('prunable')) {
    return { healthy: false, status: 'prunable', details: 'Git reports prunable' };
  }

  return { healthy: true, status: 'valid' };
}
```

#### Path Terminology and Resolution

**Critical distinction:**

| Term | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Worktree path** | `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/data-sync-worktree/.tbd/data-sync/` | **Production path**—inside hidden worktree checkout |
| **Direct path** | `.tbd/data-sync/` | **Legacy fallback path**—gitignored on main, should NEVER contain data in production |

**Invariant:** In production, the worktree path is the ONLY correct path for issue data.
The direct path exists ONLY for test fixtures that don’t use git.

**Path resolution semantics:**

```typescript
async function resolveDataSyncDir(
  baseDir: string,
  options?: { allowFallback?: boolean; repair?: boolean },
): Promise<string> {
  const worktreePath = (await resolveSharedTbdPaths(baseDir)).sharedDataSyncDir;

  // Check if worktree exists
  if (await pathExists(worktreePath)) {
    return worktreePath;
  }

  // Attempt repair if requested
  if (options?.repair) {
    const result = await initWorktree(baseDir);
    if (result.success) {
      return worktreePath;
    }
  }

  // Only allow fallback in test mode
  if (options?.allowFallback) {
    return join(baseDir, '.tbd/data-sync');
  }

  // Fail with clear error — NEVER silently fall back in production
  throw new WorktreeMissingError(
    'Shared worktree not found under $GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/data-sync-worktree/. ' +
      'Run `tbd doctor --fix` to repair.',
  );
}
```

**Rules:**

1. Production code MUST call `resolveDataSyncDir()` without `allowFallback`
2. Only test code may use `allowFallback: true`
3. If `.tbd/data-sync/issues/` contains data on main branch, this indicates a bug—data
   was written to wrong location due to missing worktree

#### Worktree Error Classes

```typescript
// packages/tbd/src/lib/errors.ts

export class WorktreeMissingError extends TbdError {
  constructor(message: string = 'Worktree not found') {
    super(message, 'WORKTREE_MISSING');
  }
}

export class WorktreeCorruptedError extends TbdError {
  constructor(message: string = 'Worktree is corrupted') {
    super(message, 'WORKTREE_CORRUPTED');
  }
}

export class SyncBranchError extends TbdError {
  constructor(message: string) {
    super(message, 'SYNC_BRANCH_ERROR');
  }
}
```

### 2.4 Workspaces

Workspaces are directories under `.tbd/workspaces/` that store issue data for sync
failure recovery, backups, and bulk editing workflows.

> **Note:** `.tbd/workspaces/` must not be gitignored—outbox data must be committed to
> the working branch.

#### Workspace Structure

Each workspace mirrors the `data-sync` directory structure:

```
.tbd/workspaces/{name}/
├── issues/           # Issue files (same format as data-sync)
├── mappings/
│   └── ids.yml       # ID mappings (union with worktree)
└── attic/            # Conflicts during workspace operations
```

#### Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `tbd save --workspace=<name>` | Save issues from worktree to workspace |
| `tbd save --outbox` | Shortcut for `--workspace=outbox --updates-only` |
| `tbd save --dir=<path>` | Save to arbitrary directory |
| `tbd import --workspace=<name>` | Import issues from workspace to worktree |
| `tbd import --outbox` | Shortcut for `--workspace=outbox --clear-on-success` |
| `tbd workspace list` | List all workspaces with issue counts by status |
| `tbd workspace delete <name>` | Delete a workspace |

#### Sync Failure Recovery Workflow

When `tbd sync` fails to push (network errors, permission issues, branch restrictions):

```bash
# 1. Save unsynced changes
tbd save --outbox

# 2. Commit to working branch (which typically succeeds)
git add .tbd/workspaces && git commit -m "tbd: save outbox" && git push

# 3. Later, when sync works again
tbd import --outbox
tbd sync
```

#### Merge Behavior

When saving or importing, issues are merged using `mergeIssues()`:

- **New issues**: Copied directly
- **Existing issues**: Three-way merge with LWW conflict resolution
- **Conflicts**: Lost values saved to attic
- **ID mappings**: Union operation (add new, don’t overwrite existing)

See `tbd shortcut sync-failure-recovery` for detailed workflow documentation.

### 2.5 Entity Collection Pattern

tbd has **one core entity type**: Issues

Future phases may add: agents, messages, workflows, templates

#### Directory Layout

| Collection | Directory | Extension | ID Prefix | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Issues | `.tbd/data-sync/issues/` | `.md` | `is-` | Task tracking (synced) |

#### Adding New Entity Types (Future)

To add a new entity type:

1. Create directory: `.tbd/data-sync/messages/` (on sync branch)

2. Define schema: `MessageSchema` in Zod

3. Define ID prefix: `ms-`

4. Define merge rules

5. Add CLI commands

No sync algorithm changes needed—sync operates on files, not schemas.

### 2.6 ID Generation

tbd uses a **dual ID system** to balance machine requirements (sorting, uniqueness) with
human usability (short, memorable):

| ID Type | Format | Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Internal** | `{type}-{ulid}` | `is-01hx5zzkbkactav9wevgemmvrz` | Storage, sorting, dependencies |
| **External** | `{project}-{short}` | `proj-a7k2` | CLI, docs, commits, references |

**Internal IDs** use [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/spec) (Universally Unique
Lexicographically Sortable Identifier):

- **Fixed prefix**: Entity type discriminator (`is-` for issues, `ms-` for messages)
- **ULID body**: 26 lowercase characters (48-bit timestamp + 80-bit randomness)
- **Lexicographic sorting**: IDs sort chronologically by creation time
- **No collisions**: Monotonic generation within millisecond prevents duplicates

**External IDs** use short alphanumeric codes mapped to internal IDs:

- **Required prefix**: Project-specific (e.g., `proj`, `myapp`, `tk`) via
  `display.id_prefix`
  - Set during `tbd init --prefix=<name>` or automatically from beads import
  - Recommended: 2-8 alphabetic characters (use `--force` for other formats)
  - Hard grammar: 1-20 lowercase characters; starts with a letter; contains letters,
    digits, dots, or underscores; ends with a letter or digit
  - Must not contain dashes (would conflict with ID separator)
- **Short code**: New IDs use base36; imported IDs may also contain dots, underscores,
  or dashes
  - Imported issues: Preserve original short ID (e.g., `100` from `tbd-100`)
  - New issues: Generate random 4-char base36
- **Immutable mapping**: Once assigned, never changes
- **No prefix matching**: Users type the full short ID, always

#### ID Generation Algorithm

```typescript
import { ulid } from 'ulid';

// Generate internal ID (ULID-based)
function generateInternalId(prefix: string = 'is'): string {
  return `${prefix}-${ulid().toLowerCase()}`;
  // e.g., "is-01hx5zzkbkactav9wevgemmvrz"
}

// Generate external short ID (base36)
function generateShortId(): string {
  // 4 base36 chars = 1.7M possibilities, 5 chars = 60M
  const chars = '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
  let result = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    result += chars[Math.floor(Math.random() * 36)];
  }
  return result; // e.g., "a7k2"
}
```

**Properties:**

- **Time-ordered**: ULIDs encode creation timestamp, enabling chronological sort by ID
- **No collisions**: ULID spec guarantees monotonic generation within same millisecond
- **Human-friendly**: Short IDs are easy to type, say, and remember
- **Deterministic sorting**: Alphabetical sort = chronological order

#### ID Mapping

The mapping between external and internal IDs is stored in
`.tbd/data-sync/mappings/ids.yml`:

```yaml
# .tbd/data-sync/mappings/ids.yml
# short_id: ulid (without prefix)
#
# Imported issues preserve their original short IDs:
100: 01hx5zzkbkactav9wevgemmvrz # from tbd-100
101: 01hx5zzkbkbctav9wevgemmvrz # from tbd-101
1823: 01hx5zzkbkcdtav9wevgemmvrz # from tbd-1823
#
# New issues get random 4-char base36 IDs:
a7k2: 01hx5zzkbkdetav9wevgemmvrz
b3m9: 01hx5zzkbkeetav9wevgemmvrz
```

**Mapping properties:**

- **Synced**: File lives on sync branch, shared across all machines
- **Immutable entries**: Once a mapping exists, it never changes
- **ID preservation**: Imports preserve original short IDs (no separate beads.yml
  needed)
- **Merge strategy**: Union (no conflicts since short IDs are unique)
- **Collision handling**: On short ID collision (rare for imports), regenerate and retry

#### ID Resolution (CLI)

When a user provides an ID:

```typescript
async function resolveId(input: string, storage: Storage): Promise<string> {
  const mapping = await storage.loadIdMapping();
  // Imported short IDs may contain a dash. Exact stored IDs win before the
  // shared display-prefix grammar strips a syntactic prefix.
  const shortId = mapping.has(input) ? input : splitPrefixedDisplayId(input)?.shortId ?? input;
  const ulid = mapping.get(shortId);

  if (!ulid) {
    throw new CLIError(`Issue not found: ${input}`);
  }

  return `is-${ulid}`; // Return full internal ID
}
```

**No prefix matching**: Unlike git refs, issue IDs are permanent references that appear
in documentation, commit messages, and external systems.
Prefix matching would cause ambiguity as more issues are created.
Users always type the full short ID.

#### File Naming

Issue files use the full internal ID:

```
.tbd/data-sync/issues/is-01hx5zzkbkactav9wevgemmvrz.md
```

**Why ULID in filename?**

- Files sort chronologically in directory listings
- Git diffs show changes in creation order
- No lookup needed to determine file path from internal ID

#### Display Format

```typescript
function formatDisplayId(internalId: string, config: Config): string {
  const ulid = internalId.replace(/^is-/, '');
  const shortId = config.idMapping.getShortId(ulid);
  const prefix = config.display.id_prefix; // Required, no default
  return `${prefix}-${shortId}`; // e.g., "proj-a7k2"
}
```

**CLI flow example (imported issue):**

```
User types:     proj-100 (or original beads ID like tbd-100)
Lookup:         100 → 01hx5zzkbkactav9wevgemmvrz
Internal ID:    is-01hx5zzkbkactav9wevgemmvrz
File path:      .tbd/data-sync/issues/is-01hx5zzkbkactav9wevgemmvrz.md
Display back:   proj-100
```

**CLI flow example (new issue):**

```
User types:     proj-a7k2
Lookup:         a7k2 → 01hx5zzkbkdetav9wevgemmvrz
Internal ID:    is-01hx5zzkbkdetav9wevgemmvrz
File path:      .tbd/data-sync/issues/is-01hx5zzkbkdetav9wevgemmvrz.md
Display back:   proj-a7k2
```

#### Type-Safe ID Handling (Branded Types)

To prevent accidentally mixing internal and display IDs at compile time, tbd uses
TypeScript branded types:

```typescript
// Branded type for internal IDs (stored in files)
declare const InternalIssueIdBrand: unique symbol;
export type InternalIssueId = string & { [InternalIssueIdBrand]: never };

// Branded type for display IDs (shown to users)
declare const DisplayIssueIdBrand: unique symbol;
export type DisplayIssueId = string & { [DisplayIssueIdBrand]: never };

// Helper functions for type casting
export function asInternalId(id: string): InternalIssueId;
export function asDisplayId(id: string): DisplayIssueId;
```

**Usage guidelines:**

| Context | Use Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `parent_id`, `dependencies`, `child_order_hints` | `InternalIssueId` | `is-01hx5zzkbk...` |
| Storage, file operations | `InternalIssueId` | Reading/writing issue files |
| CLI output, tree views | `DisplayIssueId` | `proj-a7k2` |
| User input (after resolution) | `InternalIssueId` | `resolveToInternalId()` returns this |

**Benefits:**

- **Compile-time safety**: TypeScript errors if you pass wrong ID type to a function
- **Self-documenting**: Function signatures clarify which ID format is expected
- **Refactoring safety**: Changing ID handling shows all affected call sites

### 2.7 Schemas

Schemas are defined in Zod (TypeScript).
Other languages should produce equivalent YAML/Markdown output.

#### 2.7.1 Common Types

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

// ISO8601 timestamp
const Timestamp = z.string().datetime();

// Internal Issue ID: is-{ulid} where ULID is 26 lowercase chars
// Example: is-01hx5zzkbkactav9wevgemmvrz
const InternalIssueId = z.string().regex(/^is-[0-9a-z]{26}$/);

// Short ID: 1+ lowercase alphanumeric, dot, underscore, or dash characters
// (used in external/display IDs)
// For imports: preserved from source (e.g., "100" from "tbd-100")
// For new issues: random 4-char base36 (e.g., "a7k2")
const ShortId = z.string().regex(/^[0-9a-z._-]+$/);

// External Issue ID input: accepts {prefix}-{short} or just {short}.
// Prefixes are 1-20 lowercase characters, start with a letter, may contain
// alphanumerics, dots, or underscores, and end with an alphanumeric. Hyphen is
// reserved as the prefix separator. Imported short IDs may contain separators
// but cannot end with a hyphen.
// Example: bd-100, e2e-a7k2, proj.v2-stat-in_progress, 100, a7k2
const ExternalIssueIdInput = z.string().regex(
  /^(?:[a-z](?:[a-z0-9._]{0,18}[a-z0-9])?-)?[0-9a-z._-]*[0-9a-z._]$/,
);

// Edit counter - incremented on every local change
// IMPORTANT: Version is NOT used for conflict detection (Git push rejection is used).
// Version is informational only, used for:
// - Debugging: track how many times an entity was edited
// - Merge result ordering: max(local, remote) + 1
// - Display: show edit count to users
const Version = z.number().int().nonnegative();

// Entity type discriminator
const EntityType = z.literal('is');
```

> **Version Field Clarification:** The `version` field is **purely informational**. It
> is incremented on every local change but is NOT used to detect conflicts.
> Conflict detection uses **Git push rejection** (see §3.4). This avoids the classic
> distributed systems problem where version numbers can diverge when two nodes edit
> independently. The version is useful for debugging ("how many times was this edited?")
> and is set to `max(local, remote) + 1` after merges.

#### 2.7.2 BaseEntity

All entities share common fields:

```typescript
const BaseEntity = z.object({
  type: EntityType, // Always "is" for issues
  id: IssueId,
  version: Version,
  created_at: Timestamp,
  updated_at: Timestamp,

  // Extensibility namespace for third-party data
  extensions: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()).optional(),
});
```

> **Note on `extensions`**: The `extensions` field provides a namespace for third-party
> tools, bridges, and custom integrations to store metadata without modifying core
> schemas. Keys should be namespaced (e.g., `github`, `slack`, `my-tool`). Unknown
> extensions are preserved during sync and merge (pass-through).
> 
> Example (in YAML front matter):
> 
> ```yaml
> extensions:
>   github:
>     issue_number: 123
>     synced_at: 2025-01-07T10:00:00Z
>   my-tool:
>     custom_field: value
> ```

#### 2.7.3 IssueSchema

```typescript
const IssueStatus = z.enum(['open', 'in_progress', 'blocked', 'deferred', 'closed']);
const IssueKind = z.enum(['bug', 'feature', 'task', 'epic', 'chore']);
const Priority = z.number().int().min(0).max(4);

// Dependency types - using enum for extensibility (future: 'related', 'discovered-from')
const DependencyType = z.enum(['blocks']); // Currently only "blocks" supported

const Dependency = z.object({
  type: DependencyType,
  target: IssueId,
});

const IssueSchema = BaseEntity.extend({
  type: z.literal('is'),

  title: z.string().min(1).max(500),
  description: z.string().max(50000).optional(),
  notes: z.string().max(50000).optional(), // Working notes (Beads parity)

  kind: IssueKind.default('task'),
  status: IssueStatus.default('open'),
  priority: Priority.default(2),

  assignee: z.string().optional(),
  labels: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
  dependencies: z.array(Dependency).default([]),

  // Hierarchical issues
  parent_id: IssueId.optional(),

  // Child ordering hints - soft ordering for children under this parent.
  // Array of internal IssueIds in preferred display order.
  // May contain stale IDs; display logic filters for actual children.
  child_order_hints: z.array(IssueId).nullable().optional(),

  // Spec linking - path to related spec/doc (relative to repo root)
  spec_path: z.string().optional(),

  // Beads compatibility
  due_date: Timestamp.optional(),
  deferred_until: Timestamp.optional(),

  created_by: z.string().optional(),
  closed_at: Timestamp.optional(),
  close_reason: z.string().optional(),
});

type Issue = z.infer<typeof IssueSchema>;
```

**Design notes:**

- `status`: Matches Beads statuses (open, in_progress, blocked, deferred, closed)

- `kind`: Matches Beads types (bug, feature, task, epic, chore).
  Note: CLI uses `--type` flag for Beads compatibility, which maps to the `kind` field
  internally.

- `priority`: 0 (highest/critical) to 4 (lowest), matching Beads

- `notes`: Working notes field for agents to track progress (Beads parity)

- `spec_path`: Optional path to related specification/documentation file (relative to
  repo root). Supports gradual path matching for flexible lookups - queries can match by
  filename only, partial path suffix, or exact path.
  Used for spec-first workflows where planning documents are created before
  implementation beads.

  **Path Validation and Normalization:** When setting spec_path via CLI (`--spec`),
  paths are validated and normalized:
  - File must exist at create/update time
  - Paths outside project root are rejected
  - Absolute paths within project are converted to relative
  - Relative paths from subdirectories are resolved to project root
  - Path separators are normalized (backslashes → forward slashes)
  - Leading `./` is removed

  This ensures consistent storage regardless of how the path was specified.

  **Inheritance from Parent:** When creating a child issue with `--parent` and no
  explicit `--spec`, the child automatically inherits the parent’s `spec_path`. When a
  parent’s `spec_path` is updated, the new value propagates to all children whose
  `spec_path` was null or matched the parent’s old value (i.e., was inherited).
  Children with explicitly different `spec_path` values are not affected.
  Re-parenting a child (via `tbd update --parent`) also inherits the new parent’s
  `spec_path` if the child has no existing `spec_path`.

- `child_order_hints`: Optional array of internal IssueIds specifying preferred display
  order for children of this issue.
  Used by `tbd list --pretty` to control child ordering in tree views.

  **Soft hints model:** This is a “hints” approach rather than strict ordering:
  - May contain stale IDs (deleted or re-parented issues) - silently ignored
  - May be incomplete (not all children listed) - unlisted children appear after hinted
    ones
  - No automatic cleanup when children change

  **Auto-population:** When a child is assigned to a parent via `--parent`, the child’s
  internal ID is automatically appended to the parent’s `child_order_hints`.

  **Manual control:** Use `tbd update <id> --child-order <ids>` to set the full ordering
  list. Use `--child-order ""` to clear.

  **Display:** Use `tbd show <id> --show-order` to view current hints.

- `dependencies`: Only “blocks” type for now (affects `ready` command)

- `labels`: Arbitrary string tags

- `due_date` / `deferred_until`: Beads compatibility fields.
  Stored as full ISO8601 datetime.
  CLI accepts flexible input:
  - Full datetime: `2025-02-15T10:00:00Z`

  - Date only: `2025-02-15` (normalized to `2025-02-15T00:00:00Z` UTC)

  - Relative: `+7d` (7 days from now), `+2w` (2 weeks)

**Notes on tombstone status:**

Beads has a `tombstone` status for soft-deleted issues.
In tbd, we handle deletion differently:

- Closed issues remain in `issues/` directory with `status: closed`

- Hard deletion moves the file to `attic/deleted/`

- No `tombstone` status needed

#### 2.7.4 ConfigSchema

Project configuration stored in `.tbd/config.yml`:

```yaml
# .tbd/config.yml
tbd_format: f07
tbd_version: '3.0.0'
tbd_fallback_version: '3.0.0'
tbd_upgrades:
  - version: '3.0.0'
    at: '2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'

sync:
  branch: tbd-sync # Branch name for synced data
  remote: origin # Remote repository

# Display settings
display:
  id_prefix: proj # Required: project-specific prefix (set during init or import)

# Runtime settings
settings:
  auto_sync: false # Reserved; not applied to issue writes (they stage locally; run `tbd sync`)
  index_enabled: true # Enable search indexing
```

```typescript
const ConfigSchema = z.object({
  tbd_format: z.string(),
  tbd_version: z.string(),
  tbd_fallback_version: z.string().optional(),
  tbd_upgrades: z.array(UpgradeEntrySchema).default([]),
  sync: z
    .object({
      branch: z.string().default('tbd-sync'),
      remote: z.string().default('origin'),
    })
    .default({}),
  display: z.object({
    id_prefix: z.string(), // Required: set during init or auto-detected from beads import
  }),
  settings: z
    .object({
      auto_sync: z.boolean().default(false), // reserved; issue writes stage locally
      index_enabled: z.boolean().default(true),
    })
    .default({}),
}).passthrough();
```

> **Forward Compatibility Policy:** As of repository format `f07`, `ConfigSchema` uses
> Zod’s `passthrough()` mode at the top level.
> The `integrations` block and its provider objects are passthrough too.
> Unknown keys in those locations therefore survive an older f07-or-later client
> rewriting `config.yml`.
> 
> 1. A purely additive top-level config block, or an additive key inside an explicitly
>    passthrough integration/provider object, does not by itself require another format
>    bump once the repository is on f07.
> 2. Bump the format for removals, renames, semantic changes, or additions inside a
>    nested schema that still strips unknown keys whenever an older supported client
>    could lose or misinterpret data.
> 3. Pre-f07 clients still parse in strip mode.
>    The f07 gate makes those clients fail before they can rewrite configuration, with
>    an instruction to upgrade via `npm install -g get-tbd@latest`.
> 
> This preserves future additive configuration while keeping destructive or semantic
> changes behind an explicit, migratable compatibility gate.
> See `tbd-format.ts` for format version history and `config.ts` for the compatibility
> check via `isCompatibleFormat()`.
> 
> For the rules that govern adding a new format (idempotent migration, write order,
> signing-agnostic commits, doctor recovery contract), see the project-local
> [docs/tbd-format-versioning.md](../../../docs/tbd-format-versioning.md) contributor
> guide.

#### 2.7.5 MetaSchema

Shared metadata stored in `.tbd/data-sync/meta.yml` on the sync branch:

```typescript
const MetaSchema = z.object({
  schema_version: z.number().int(),
  created_at: Timestamp,
});
```

> **Note**: `last_sync_at` is intentionally NOT stored in `meta.yml`. Syncing this file
> would create a conflict hotspot—every node updates it on every sync, causing constant
> merge conflicts. Instead, sync timestamps are tracked locally in `.tbd/state.yml`
> (gitignored).

#### 2.7.6 LocalStateSchema

Per-node state stored in `.tbd/state.yml` (gitignored, never synced).
Each machine maintains its own local state:

```typescript
const LocalStateSchema = z.object({
  last_sync_at: Timestamp.optional(), // When this node last synced successfully
});
```

> **Why local?** The `last_sync_at` timestamp is inherently per-node.
> Storing it in synced state would cause every sync to modify the same file, creating a
> guaranteed conflict generator.
> Keeping it local eliminates this hotspot.

> **Future extensions:** Additional fields like `node_id`, `last_synced_commit` (for
> incremental sync), or separate `last_push`/`last_pull` timestamps may be added as
> needed.

#### 2.7.7 AtticEntrySchema

Preserved conflict losers:

```typescript
const AtticEntrySchema = z.object({
  entity_id: IssueId,
  timestamp: Timestamp,
  field: z.string().optional(), // Specific field or full entity
  lost_value: z.unknown(),
  winner_source: z.enum(['local', 'remote']),
  loser_source: z.enum(['local', 'remote']),
  context: z.object({
    local_version: Version,
    remote_version: Version,
    local_updated_at: Timestamp,
    remote_updated_at: Timestamp,
  }),
});
```

### 2.8 Relationship Types

tbd supports two distinct types of relationships between issues: **parent-child**
(hierarchical containment) and **dependencies** (blocking relationships).
This section documents the model, compares it to Beads, and explains the design
rationale.

#### 2.8.1 Relationship Model Overview

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  group related tasks                     track soft relationships           │
│                                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 2.8.2 Parent-Child Relationships

Parent-child relationships use the `parent_id` field for hierarchical organization:

```yaml
# Child issue
id: is-01hx5zzkbkactav9wevgemmvrz
title: Implement OAuth login
parent_id: is-01hx5zzkbkbctav9wevgemmvrz # Points to parent epic
```

**Key properties:**

- **Non-blocking**: A child can be in `ready` state even if its parent is open
- **Organizational**: Used for grouping tasks under epics or features
- **Single parent**: Each issue can have at most one parent
- **Visualized by**: `tbd list --pretty`, `tbd list --parent <id>`
- **Context inheritance**: `tbd show` auto-displays parent context for child issues, so
  child descriptions don’t need to duplicate the parent’s context (suppress with
  `--no-parent`)

**Commands:**

```bash
# Create with parent
tbd create "Implement OAuth" --parent proj-a1b2

# Set parent on existing issue
tbd update proj-c3d4 --parent proj-a1b2

# List children of a parent
tbd list --parent proj-a1b2
```

**Child ordering:**

When displaying children under a parent, tbd uses `child_order_hints` to control display
order. This provides soft ordering hints - the parent suggests a display order for its
children.

```bash
# Reorder children explicitly (replaces all hints)
tbd update proj-a1b2 --child-order proj-c3d4,proj-e5f6,proj-g7h8

# View current ordering
tbd show proj-a1b2 --show-order
```

**Ordering behavior:**

- **Auto-population**: When setting `--parent` on create/update, the child is
  automatically appended to the parent’s `child_order_hints`
- **Manual control**: Use `--child-order` to set explicit ordering
- **Soft hints**: Hints may contain stale IDs (removed children); display logic filters
  for actual children only
- **Fallback**: Children not in hints are sorted by priority, then ID
- **Tree view**: `tbd list --pretty` respects hint ordering within each parent’s
  children

#### 2.8.3 Dependency Relationships

Dependencies use the `dependencies` array for ordering and linking:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - type: blocks
    target: is-01hx5zzkbkbctav9wevgemmvrz
```

**Supported dependency types:**

| Type | Affects Ready? | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blocks` | **Yes** | “This issue must close before target can proceed” |
| `related` | No | Soft link: “See also” references (future) |
| `discovered-from` | No | Provenance: “Found while working on X” (future) |

**Commands:**

```bash
# Add blocking dependency: A blocks B (B can't proceed until A closes)
tbd dep add proj-a1b2 proj-c3d4

# List what an issue blocks / is blocked by
tbd dep list proj-a1b2

# Remove dependency
tbd dep remove proj-a1b2 proj-c3d4
```

#### 2.8.4 Visualization Commands

Each relationship type has dedicated visualization:

| Command | Shows | Data Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tbd list --pretty` | Parent-child hierarchy tree | `parent_id` field |
| `tbd list --parent <id>` | Children of a specific issue | `parent_id` field |
| `tbd blocked` | Issues blocked + their blockers | `dependencies[].type: blocks` |
| `tbd ready` | Unblocked, unassigned issues | Excludes blocked issues |
| `tbd dep tree <id>` | Blocking dependency chain | `dependencies[].type: blocks` (future) |
| `tbd list --format dot` | Full graph (Graphviz) | All relationships |

#### 2.8.5 Comparison with Beads

tbd and Beads have different models for parent-child relationships:

| Aspect | tbd | Beads |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parent-child storage | `parent_id` field | `dependencies[].type: parent-child` |
| Parent-child blocking | **No** (organizational only) | **Transitive** (inherits parent’s blocked state) |
| Dependency types | `blocks` only (more planned) | `blocks`, `parent-child`, `related`, `discovered-from`, + more |

**Understanding Beads’ parent-child behavior:**

In Beads, `parent-child` is listed as affecting ready work:

```go
// Beads: AffectsReadyWork includes parent-child
func (d DependencyType) AffectsReadyWork() bool {
  return d == DepBlocks || d == DepParentChild || ...
}
```

However, this does NOT mean children are blocked until their parent closes.
The actual behavior (from `attic/beads/internal/storage/sqlite/blocked_cache.go`) is
**transitive blocking**:

1. Only `blocks` (and similar types) can DIRECTLY block an issue
2. `parent-child` PROPAGATES blockage: if a parent is blocked, children inherit that
   blockage

So in Beads:

- Creating a task under an open epic does NOT block the task
- If the epic itself becomes blocked (by a `blocks` dependency), children are
  transitively blocked
- If the epic is open (not blocked), children CAN be ready to work on

**tbd’s simpler model:**

tbd separates these concepts entirely:

- **`parent_id`**: Organizational containment (non-blocking, no transitive effects)
- **`blocks`**: Temporal ordering (blocking)

This is simpler because:

```
Epic: "Build Auth System" (open)
├── Task: "Design UI" (open, READY)      ← Can work on this
├── Task: "Implement OAuth" (open, READY) ← Can work on this
└── Task: "Write tests" (blocked by OAuth) ← Must wait for OAuth
```

In tbd, blocking is explicit via `blocks` dependencies only.
There’s no transitive blocking through the parent-child hierarchy.
This makes the blocking model easier to reason about.

#### 2.8.6 Future Dependency Types

Based on real-world Beads usage data (from Beads’ own issue tracker):

| Type | Beads Usage | Priority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `blocks` | 47% (156 uses) | ✅ Supported | Core workflow |
| `parent-child` | 42% (140 uses) | ✅ Via `parent_id` | Different model (non-blocking) |
| `discovered-from` | 11% (37 uses) | 🔜 High | Useful for provenance tracking |
| `related` | <1% (2 uses) | ⏳ Low | Rarely used in practice |

Planned additions:

- **`discovered-from`**: Track issue provenance when work reveals new issues
- **`related`**: Soft links for “see also” references

#### 2.8.7 Future: Transitive Blocking Option

**Current design:** `parent_id` is purely organizational with no blocking effects.
Blocking is explicit via `blocks` dependencies only.

**Potential future enhancement:** Add opt-in transitive blocking through parent-child
hierarchy, similar to Beads’ model.

**How it would work:**

```yaml
# .tbd/config.yml
blocking:
  transitive_parent_child: true # default: false
```

When enabled:

- If a parent epic is blocked (by a `blocks` dependency), children inherit that blockage
- Children are NOT blocked just because their parent is open
- Closing the blocker on the parent automatically unblocks all children

**Use case:** Large projects where blocking an epic should cascade to all child tasks,
preventing work on children when the parent is gated by external factors.

**Trade-offs:**

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current (explicit only) | Simpler, predictable | Must manually block children |
| Transitive (opt-in) | Automatic cascading | Hidden transitive effects |

**Decision:** Start with explicit-only blocking (simpler).
Add transitive blocking as an opt-in feature if users request it after real-world usage.

### 2.9 Managed Docs: Copies, Forks, and Synchronization

tbd manages documentation (guidelines, shortcuts, templates) alongside issues.
With forkable docs (format f05, `plan-2026-06-11-forkable-docs.md`), a doc can exist as
up to **four copies plus a manifest**, each with a distinct owner and lifecycle.
This section states that model and the invariants that make every combination of user
actions safe.

#### The copies

| Copy | Location | In git? | Written by | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bundled | npm package (`dist/docs/`) | n/a (per tbd version) | tbd releases | The upstream for `internal:` docs; immutable per installed version |
| Cache | `.tbd/docs/` | gitignored | doc sync only | Complete, pristine, machine-local mirror of all upstream docs (bundled + URL sources); disposable |
| Fork | `docs/tbd/<kind>/<name>.md` | tracked | `tbd docs fork/update` + the user/agent | The editable copy that tbd serves; optional, per-doc |
| Base | `.tbd/doc-forks/base/<kind>/<name>.md` | tracked | `tbd docs fork/update` | Verbatim upstream snapshot at the fork point; the three-way merge base |
| Manifest | `.tbd/doc-forks/forks.yml` | tracked | `tbd docs fork/unfork/update` | Provenance per fork: source docref, `base_hash` (LF-normalized sha256), `tbd_version` at fork point, `conflicted` flag |

A doc’s identity is **kind and name**; paths follow fixed conventions
(`<kind-dir>/<name>.md`, flat; nested folders are not scanned).

The model follows one principle: **resolve by convention; track only what cannot be
derived; publish the inventory as a generated view.** Lookup is a fixed search path over
conventional locations; no registry that can drift from disk.
The only stored tracking is the fork manifest, which records the one fact that cannot be
recomputed from the files: each fork’s upstream source and base snapshot.
The docmap that doc commands emit is a generated view of this state, never an input to
resolution. (A copy-all-and-gitignore variant of the fork dir was considered and
rejected: gitignored mirrors are invisible on GitHub and in PRs, and edits to them
diverge silently with no team-visible artifact; `tbd docs fork --all` provides the
all-visible posture in tracked form.
See the spec’s Alternatives.)

#### Invariants

1. **Serving precedence**: the fork dir is prepended to every kind’s lookup path, so a
   forked (or hand-authored local) file shadows the cache copy by name.
   With nothing forked, lookup paths reduce to the cache and behavior is byte-identical
   to pre-f05.
2. **Cache completeness**: doc sync always installs *all* upstream docs into the cache,
   including forked ones.
   The cache copy is the pristine reference: the staleness comparator, the “theirs” side
   of every update merge, and the fallback after unfork.
3. **The cache is never authored**: only doc sync writes it, nothing else reads from
   anywhere else for upstream content, and deleting it is always safe (auto-sync
   regenerates it on the next doc access, including on fresh clones).
4. **Tracked files mutate only via explicit `tbd docs` verbs** (fork/unfork/update).
   Setup, `tbd sync`, and background auto-sync refresh the cache and *report* drift but
   never write the fork dir, bases, or manifest.
5. **Tracking is derived, not stored**: every doc state
   (`upstream/forked/customized/stale/conflicted/local/missing/orphaned`) is a pure
   function of (manifest entry present?, file hash, base hash, cache hash, conflicted
   flag, markers present).
   There is no hidden database, so no sequence of git operations (commit, pull, merge,
   revert, partial commits) can desynchronize tbd from the files: collaborators
   recompute identical states from identical content.
6. **The base is the fork point**: advanced only by fork (refresh) and update; with the
   stored snapshot, `customized` (file ≠ base), `stale` (cache ≠ base), and three-way
   merging are exact, offline operations for every collaborator regardless of which tbd
   version created the fork.
7. **The format gate**: forking bumps nothing at runtime, but the f05 `tbd_format` in
   `config.yml` (mirrored into the machine-local common-dir `layout.yml`) makes pre-f05
   clients refuse the repo; they would otherwise serve upstream copies of docs the team
   has customized. Within the f05 era, the manifest’s per-entry `tbd_version` guards the
   remaining skew: `tbd docs update` refuses to touch a doc whose fork point was
   advanced by a newer tbd than the one running, since that client’s bundled “upstream”
   is older than the fork point and updating would silently downgrade the doc.

#### Who writes what (synchronization flows)

| Flow | Reads | Writes | Tracked files touched |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| npm upgrade | — | bundle | none |
| Doc sync (`tbd sync --docs`, auto-sync, setup) | bundle + URL sources | cache | none |
| `tbd docs fork` | cache | fork file, base, manifest, fork-dir README | yes (explicit) |
| `tbd docs update` | cache, base, fork file | fork file and/or base, manifest, README | yes (explicit) |
| `tbd docs unfork` | base, fork file | removes fork artifacts, README | yes (explicit) |
| User/agent edits | — | fork dir (any way they like) | yes (theirs) |
| git operations | — | any tracked artifact | yes (theirs) |

Staleness appears exactly when doc sync moves the cache past a fork’s base; awareness
surfaces (`tbd docs status`, the one-line `tbd sync` drift notice) report it, and only
the explicit `tbd docs update` acts on it.

#### Drift and degraded modes

Because of invariant 5, arbitrary user actions in the fork dir resolve to defined
states: edits → `customized`; deletion → `missing` (serving falls back to the cache);
rename → `missing` + `local`; new files → `local` (served, no upstream); deleting the
manifest → everything `local` (serving unaffected); moving into subfolders → not scanned
(documented). Degraded modes fail soft: an unreachable URL source keeps serving the
last-good cache copy; an empty cache self-heals via auto-sync; a deleted base blocks
merging only for that doc (repairable via `update --keep-ours`); the upgrade abort path
is specified in `tbd-docs.md` §Troubleshooting.
The drift matrix with resolutions is user-facing in `tbd-docs.md` §“Forked Docs in Your
Repo”; the state matrix, update decision table, and drift scenarios are pinned by
`fork-manifest`/`fork-update`/`doc-fork` unit tests and the `cli-docs-fork`/
`cli-docs-update` golden tryscripts.

## 3. Git Layer

### 3.1 Overview

The Git Layer defines synchronization using standard git commands.
It operates on files without interpreting entity schemas beyond what’s needed for
merging.

**Key properties:**

- **Schema-agnostic sync**: File transfer via standard git push/pull

- **Schema-aware merge**: When push rejected, merge rules are applied per-entity-type

- **Standard git**: All operations use git CLI

- **Dedicated sync branch**: `tbd-sync` branch never pollutes main

- **Git-based conflict detection**: Push rejection triggers fetch and field-level merge

**Critical Invariant:** tbd MUST NEVER modify the user’s git index or staging area.
All git plumbing operations that write to the sync branch MUST use an isolated index
file via `GIT_INDEX_FILE` environment variable.
This ensures that a developer’s staged changes are never corrupted by tbd operations.

```bash
# Example: all sync branch writes use isolated index
export GIT_INDEX_FILE="$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/tbd-index"
```

### 3.2 Sync Branch Architecture

```
main branch:                    tbd-sync branch:
├── src/                        └── .tbd/
├── tests/                          └── data-sync/
├── README.md                           ├── issues/
├── .tbd/                               ├── attic/
│   ├── config.yml      (committed)     └── meta.yml
│   ├── .gitignore      (committed)
│   ├── .gitattributes  (committed)
│   ├── workspaces/     (committed)
│   ├── state.yml   (gitignored)
│   ├── docs/       (gitignored)
│   └── data-sync-worktree/ (gitignored)
└── ...
```

**Why separate branches?**

1. **No conflicts on main**: Coordination data never creates merge conflicts in feature
   branches

2. **Simple allow-listing**: Cloud sandboxes can allow push to `tbd-sync` only

3. **Shared across branches**: All feature branches see the same issues

4. **Clean git history**: Issue updates don’t pollute code commit history

#### Files Committed on Main Branch

```
.tbd/config.yml       # Project configuration (YAML)
.tbd/.gitignore       # Controls what's gitignored below
.tbd/.gitattributes   # Merge strategies (merge=union for ids.yml)
.tbd/workspaces/      # Persistent state (outbox, named workspaces)
.tbd/doc-forks/       # Fork manifest + base snapshots (see §2.9; f05+)
docs/tbd/             # Forked docs, outside .tbd/ (see §2.9; only when fork is used)
```

#### Files Gitignored (local only)

```
.tbd/state.yml              # Per-node sync state
.tbd/docs/                  # Installed documentation (regenerated on setup)
.tbd/backups/               # Legacy local backups
.tbd/data-sync-worktree/    # Legacy per-checkout worktree path
.tbd/data-sync/             # Reserved for potential future "simple mode"
$GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/        # Shared local sync worktree, locks, backups
```

#### Files Tracked on tbd-sync Branch

```
.tbd/data-sync/issues/     # Issue entities
.tbd/data-sync/attic/      # Conflict archive
.tbd/data-sync/mappings/   # ID mappings
  ids.yml                  # Short ID → ULID mapping (includes preserved import IDs)
.tbd/data-sync/meta.yml    # Metadata
```

### 3.3 Sync Operations

Sync uses standard git commands to read/write the sync branch without checking it out.

#### 3.3.1 Reading from Sync Branch

```bash
# Read a file from sync branch without checkout
git show tbd-sync:.tbd/data-sync/issues/is-a1b2.md

# List files in issues directory
git ls-tree tbd-sync .tbd/data-sync/issues/
```

#### 3.3.2 Writing to Sync Branch

All write operations use an isolated index to protect user’s staged changes:

```bash
# Setup isolated index
export GIT_INDEX_FILE="$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/tbd-index"

# 1. Fetch latest
git fetch origin tbd-sync

# 2. Read current sync branch state into isolated index
git read-tree tbd-sync

# 3. Update index with local changes
#    (issue files from .tbd/data-sync/issues/ are added to the tree)
git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644,<blob-sha>,".tbd/data-sync/issues/is-a1b2c3.md"

# 4. Write tree from isolated index
TREE=$(git write-tree)

# 5. Create commit on sync branch
COMMIT=$(git commit-tree $TREE -p tbd-sync -m "tbd sync: $(date -Iseconds)")

# 6. Update sync branch ref
git update-ref refs/heads/tbd-sync $COMMIT

# 7. Push to remote
git push origin tbd-sync
```

**Push Retry Algorithm (V2-005):**

If push is rejected (non-fast-forward), retry with merge:

```
MAX_RETRIES = 3

for attempt in 1..MAX_RETRIES:
  1. git fetch origin tbd-sync
  2. Compute diff between prepared_commit and origin/tbd-sync
  3. For each conflicting file:
     - Load both versions as JSON
     - Apply merge rules (section 3.5)
     - Write merged result, save losers to attic
  4. Create new tree with merged files
  5. Create new commit with both parents (merge commit)
  6. git push origin tbd-sync
  7. If push succeeds: done
  8. If push rejected: continue to next attempt

If all attempts fail:
  - Exit with error code 1
  - Output: "Sync failed after 3 attempts. Manual resolution required."
  - Suggest: "Run 'tbd sync --status' to see pending changes."
```

#### 3.3.3 Sync Algorithm

High-level sync flow:

```
SYNC(options):
  0. PREREQUISITE: Acquire $GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/locks/data-sync.lock
  1. Verify shared worktree health (see §2.3.4)
     - If missing/prunable: repair shared worktree
     - If corrupted: throw WorktreeCorruptedError and route to doctor --fix
  2. Resolve data path via resolveDataSyncDir() — uses worktree path
  3. Fetch remote sync branch
  4. Update worktree to remote state (preserving local uncommitted changes)
  5. Commit worktree changes to sync branch
  6. Push to remote
  7. If push rejected (non-fast-forward): retry with merge (see 3.3.2)
```

**Critical Invariant:** All operations in steps 1-6 MUST use the resolved `dataSyncDir`
path consistently. Never read from or write to `.tbd/data-sync/` directly—always go
through the shared worktree at `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/data-sync-worktree/.tbd/data-sync/`.

**Why most syncs are trivial (no merge needed):**

The file-per-entity design means parallel work rarely conflicts at the git level:

| Scenario | Git behavior | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A creates issue-1, B creates issue-2 | Different files added | Trivial merge |
| A modifies issue-1, B creates issue-2 | Different files | Trivial merge |
| A and B both modify issue-1 | Same file modified | Field-level merge |

Only when two agents modify the **same issue** before syncing does tbd need to perform
field-level merging.
This is rare in practice because:

- Issues are small, focused units of work
- Agents typically work on different issues
- The `ready` command distributes work across agents

### 3.4 Conflict Detection and Resolution

#### When Conflicts Occur

Conflicts (requiring field-level merge) happen when the same issue file is modified in
two places before sync:

- Two environments modify the same issue before syncing

- Same issue modified on two machines offline

#### Detection

Conflict detection uses **Git’s standard push mechanics**:

```
git push fails with non-fast-forward → merge needed
```

When a push is rejected because the remote has changes, tbd:

1. Fetches the remote sync branch
2. For each local issue, checks if a remote version exists via `git show`
3. If remote version exists and differs, triggers the merge algorithm

The `version` field is purely informational (edit counter) and is NOT used for conflict
detection. This avoids the distributed systems problem where version numbers diverge
independently.

> **Why Git-based detection?** Git’s push rejection is reliable, well-tested
> infrastructure. By letting Git handle conflict detection at the transport level, tbd
> keeps its implementation simple and focuses on field-level merge resolution.

#### Resolution Flow

```
1. Detect: git push rejected (non-fast-forward)
2. Fetch remote changes
3. For each local issue:
   a. Try to read remote version via git show
   b. If remote exists and differs, parse both as YAML+Markdown
   c. Apply merge rules (field-level, from section 3.5)
   d. Increment version: max(local, remote) + 1
   e. Write merged result to worktree
   f. Save loser values to attic (for LWW fields that differed)
4. Commit merged changes to sync branch
5. Retry push (up to 3 attempts)
```

> **Note on Attic Entries**: Attic entries are created only when a merge strategy
> **discards** data (e.g., LWW picks one scalar over another, or one text block over
> another). Union-style merges that retain both values (e.g., labels, dependencies) do
> not create attic entries since no data is lost.
> This ensures the attic remains focused on actual data loss, not routine merges.

### 3.5 Merge Rules

Field-level merge strategies:

| Strategy | Behavior | Used For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `immutable` | Error if different | `type`, `id` |
| `lww` | Last-write-wins by timestamp | Scalars (title, status, priority) |
| `lww_with_attic` | LWW, preserve loser in attic | Long text (description) |
| `union` | Combine arrays, dedupe, sort | Labels |
| `merge_by_id` | Merge arrays by item ID, sort | Dependencies |
| `max_plus_one` | `max(local, remote) + 1` | `version` |
| `recalculate` | Fresh timestamp | `updated_at` |
| `preserve_oldest` | Keep earliest value | `created_at`, `created_by` |
| `deep_merge_by_key` | Union keys, LWW per key | `extensions` |

**LWW Tie-Breaker Rule:**

When `updated_at` timestamps are equal, use this deterministic tie-breaker:

1. Prefer remote over local (convention: remote is “more shared”)

2. If still ambiguous (e.g., same node), prefer lexically greater content hash

3. Always preserve losing value in attic

> **Rationale:** Equal timestamps are common with coarse clocks, imports, or identical
> writes. A deterministic tie-breaker prevents oscillation and ensures consistent merges
> across nodes.

#### BaseEntity Merge Rules

All entities share these base field merge rules:

```typescript
const baseEntityMergeRules = {
  type: { strategy: 'immutable' },
  id: { strategy: 'immutable' },
  version: { strategy: 'max_plus_one' },
  created_at: { strategy: 'preserve_oldest' },
  updated_at: { strategy: 'recalculate' }, // Always set to merge time
  extensions: { strategy: 'deep_merge_by_key' },
};
```

#### Issue Merge Rules

```typescript
const issueMergeRules: MergeRules<Issue> = {
  // BaseEntity fields (inherited)
  ...baseEntityMergeRules,

  // Issue-specific fields
  kind: { strategy: 'lww' },
  title: { strategy: 'lww' },
  description: { strategy: 'lww_with_attic' },
  notes: { strategy: 'lww_with_attic' },
  status: { strategy: 'lww' },
  priority: { strategy: 'lww' },
  assignee: { strategy: 'lww' },
  labels: { strategy: 'union' },
  dependencies: { strategy: 'merge_by_id', key: (d) => d.target },
  parent_id: { strategy: 'lww' },
  spec_path: { strategy: 'lww' },
  due_date: { strategy: 'lww' },
  deferred_until: { strategy: 'lww' },
  created_by: { strategy: 'preserve_oldest' },
  closed_at: { strategy: 'lww' }, // See status/closed_at rules below
  close_reason: { strategy: 'lww' },
  child_order_hints: { strategy: 'union' }, // Append-only set of child IDs; union (dedupe)
};
```

**Status and closed_at Interaction:**

- If merged `status` becomes `closed` and `closed_at` is not set, set it to merge time

- If merged `status` changes from `closed` to another status (reopen), clear `closed_at`

- `close_reason` follows LWW independently

**Extensions Deep Merge:**

The `extensions` field uses per-namespace merging to preserve third-party data:

```typescript
// Example: merging extensions
local.extensions = { github: { issue: 123 }, slack: { channel: 'dev' } };
remote.extensions = { github: { pr: 456 }, jira: { key: 'PROJ-1' } };

// Result: union of keys, per-key LWW for conflicts
merged.extensions = {
  github: { pr: 456 }, // remote wins (LWW on github namespace)
  slack: { channel: 'dev' }, // preserved from local
  jira: { key: 'PROJ-1' }, // preserved from remote
};
// Note: github.issue lost because remote's github namespace won LWW
// The losing github namespace is preserved in attic
```

### 3.6 Attic Structure

The attic preserves data lost in conflicts:

```
.tbd/data-sync/attic/
└── conflicts/
    └── is-a1b2/
        ├── 2025-01-07T10-30-00Z_description.yml
        └── 2025-01-07T11-45-00Z_full.yml
```

**Attic entry format:**

```json
{
  "entity_id": "is-a1b2",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-07T10:30:00Z",
  "field": "description",
  "lost_value": "Original description text",
  "winner_source": "remote",
  "loser_source": "local",
  "context": {
    "local_version": 3,
    "remote_version": 3,
    "local_updated_at": "2025-01-07T10:25:00Z",
    "remote_updated_at": "2025-01-07T10:28:00Z"
  }
}
```

### 3.7 Read-Only Remote Observation

Sync (§3.3) is the only operation that writes issue state.
A second, narrower Git-layer operation exists so that a process can learn *that* state
changed without changing anything itself: the observation path behind `tbd changes` and
`tbd watch` (§4.14).

**Invariant:** observation MUST NOT write any state another process can see.
Concretely, it never takes the data-sync lock, never touches the hidden worktree, never
updates the local sync branch or its remote-tracking ref, and never writes `FETCH_HEAD`.
This is what makes it safe to run several watchers beside ordinary `tbd sync` in one
checkout.

**Reading committed snapshots.** Both commands read issues straight out of commit
objects, never from a checkout:

```bash
# One snapshot: issue blobs plus the ID mapping, resolved from a commit
git ls-tree -r -z <commit> -- .tbd/data-sync/issues .tbd/data-sync/mappings/ids.yml
git cat-file --batch   # 128 object IDs per invocation
```

Blob reads are batched (128 objects per `cat-file`) so peak memory tracks the batch, not
the repository. Each snapshot is validated on read: file names must match the issue ID
inside, issue files must not be nested, and every issue must have a row in `ids.yml`. An
unparseable snapshot fails the command rather than silently reporting a partial diff.

Because the baseline and tip are commits, a change report is a pure function of two
commit IDs: the same pair always yields the same report.

**Observing the remote.** `tbd watch` learns the remote tip with
`git ls-remote --exit-code <remote> refs/heads/<sync-branch>`, which transfers no
objects.
Only when that tip moves does it fetch, and the fetch is aimed at a private ref:

```bash
git fetch --no-write-fetch-head --no-tags --refmap= \
  <remote> +refs/heads/<sync-branch>:refs/tbd/watch/<pid>-<uuid>
```

Each flag protects one piece of shared state:

| Flag | Protects |
| --- | --- |
| explicit `+refs/heads/<branch>:refs/tbd/watch/...` destination | the local sync branch |
| `--refmap=` | `refs/remotes/<remote>/<branch>`, which a configured remote refspec would otherwise advance beside the explicit one |
| `--no-write-fetch-head` | `FETCH_HEAD`, which other tooling reads |
| `--no-tags` | tag refs |

Private refs live under `refs/tbd/watch/` and are named `<pid>-<uuid>`, so concurrent
watchers in one checkout cannot collide.
A watcher deletes its own ref on exit; a watcher that starts up first reclaims refs
whose owning PID is no longer running, so a killed process leaves no permanent garbage.

**Bounded network calls.** Every network-facing Git process gets a positive wall-time
limit, so a hung transport ends the command instead of blocking an unattended worker
forever. One remote observation plus its fetch and ref resolution share a single budget:
the poll interval, capped at 30 seconds, and further clipped by any remaining
`--timeout` budget.

## 4. CLI Layer

### 4.1 Overview

The CLI Layer provides a Beads-compatible command interface.

**Key properties:**

- **Implementation-agnostic**: Can be in TypeScript, Rust, Python, etc.

- **Beads-compatible**: Same command names and common options

- **Dual output**: Human-readable by default, JSON for scripting

- **Exit codes**: 0 for success, non-zero for errors

### 4.1.1 Initialization Requirements

All tbd commands require the repository to be initialized, except:

- `tbd init`—Creates a new tbd repository
- `tbd import --from-beads`—Can initialize and import in one step (auto-runs init if
  needed)

**Behavior when not initialized:**

If `.tbd/config.yml` does not exist or is invalid, commands exit with an error:

- **Exit code**: 1
- **Error message**:
  `Error: Not a tbd repository (run 'tbd init' or 'tbd import --from-beads' first)`

**Detection logic:**

1. Check for `.tbd/config.yml` existence
2. Validate the config and require its `tbd_format` to be compatible (`tbd_version` is
   informational)
3. If either check fails → error with initialization instructions

**Commands and their initialization requirements:**

| Command | Requires Init | Behavior if Not Initialized |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `init` | No | Creates `.tbd/` directory and sync branch |
| `status` | No | Shows detection results and guidance (see §4.9) |
| `import --from-beads` | No | Auto-initializes, then imports |
| `import <file>` | Yes | Error: “Not a tbd repository” |
| `list`, `show`, `stats` | Yes | Error: “Not a tbd repository” |
| `create`, `update`, `close`, `reopen` | Yes | Error: “Not a tbd repository” |
| `ready`, `blocked`, `stale` | Yes | Error: “Not a tbd repository” |
| `label`, `dep` | Yes | Error: “Not a tbd repository” |
| `sync`, `search`, `doctor`, `config` | Yes | Error: “Not a tbd repository” |
| `attic list/show/restore` | Yes | Error: “Not a tbd repository” |
| All other commands | Yes | Error: “Not a tbd repository” |

**`import --from-beads` auto-initialization:**

When `--from-beads` is used and `.tbd/` doesn’t exist:

1. Auto-run equivalent of `tbd init` silently
2. Proceed with import from Beads repository
3. Report: “Initialized tbd and imported N issues from Beads”

This enables a one-step migration workflow:

```bash
# In a repo with .beads/ directory
tbd import --from-beads    # Initializes AND imports in one command
```

### 4.2 Command Structure

```
tbd <command> [subcommand] [args] [options]
```

**Note**: CLI command is `tbd` (singular) to avoid conflict with shell `cd`.

### 4.3 Initialization

```bash
tbd init --prefix=<name> [options]

Options:
  --prefix=<name>       Required: project prefix for display IDs (2-8 alphabetic recommended)
  --force               Allow non-recommended prefix format
  --sync-branch=<name>  Sync branch name (default: tbd-sync)
  --remote=<name>       Remote name (default: origin)
```

The `--prefix` option is **required** unless you’re importing from an existing beads
repository (which automatically detects and uses the beads prefix).

**Prefix validation rules:**

- **Recommended** (no --force needed): 2-8 alphabetic characters (e.g., `tbd`, `proj`,
  `myapp`)
- **Valid with --force**: 1-20 lowercase characters, starting with a letter, ending with
  alphanumeric, middle characters can include dots (`.`) and underscores (`_`)
- **Never allowed**: Dashes (`-`) are not allowed as they break ID syntax (e.g.,
  `tbd-a1b2` would be ambiguous)

**What it does:**

1. Creates `.tbd/` directory with `config.yml` (including display.id_prefix),
   `.gitignore`, and `.gitattributes` (merge=union for ids.yml)

2. Creates `.tbd/docs/` directories for shortcuts, guidelines, templates (gitignored)

3. Creates `tbd-sync` branch with `.tbd/data-sync/` structure

4. Pushes sync branch to origin (if remote exists)

5. Returns to original branch

6. Outputs instructions to commit config

**Output:**

```
Initialized tbd in /path/to/repo
Created sync branch: tbd-sync
Pushed sync branch to origin

To complete setup, commit the config files:
  git add .tbd/config.yml .tbd/.gitignore .tbd/.gitattributes
  git commit -m "Initialize tbd"
```

### 4.4 Issue Commands

#### Create

```bash
tbd create [<title>] [options]

Options:
  --from-file <path>        Create from YAML+Markdown file (all fields)
  --type <type>             Issue type: bug, feature, task, epic, chore (default: task)
  --priority <0-4>          Priority (0=critical, 4=lowest, default: 2)
  --description <text>      Description ("-" reads stdin)
  --file <path>             Read description from file ("-" reads stdin)
  --assignee <name>         Assignee
  --due <date>              Due date (ISO8601)
  --defer <date>            Defer until date (ISO8601)
  --parent=<id>             Parent issue ID
  --spec <path>             Link to spec (literal path, or unique filename/suffix
                            resolved like `list --spec`)
  --depends-on <id>         Blocker this issue depends on (repeatable)
  --label <label>           Add label (repeatable)
```

> **Note on `--type` flag:** The CLI flag `--type` sets the issue’s `kind` field, NOT
> the `type` field. The `type` field is the entity discriminator (always `is` for issues)
> and is set automatically.
> This naming choice maintains Beads CLI compatibility where `--type` was used for issue
> classification.

**Examples:**

```bash
tbd create "Fix authentication bug" --type=bug --priority=P1
tbd create "Add OAuth" --type=feature --label=backend --label=security
tbd create "Write tests" --parent proj-a1b2
tbd create "API docs" --file design.md

# Create from full YAML+Markdown file
tbd create --from-file new-issue.md
```

**`--from-file` behavior:**

- Reads the YAML frontmatter and Markdown body from file

- Validates against IssueSchema

- Ignores `id` field in file (generates new ID)

- Ignores `version`, `created_at`, `updated_at` (set automatically)

- Title is required in the file’s frontmatter (or use `<title>` argument to override)

**Output:**

```
Created proj-a1b2: Fix authentication bug
```

#### List

```bash
tbd list [options]

Options:
  --status <status>         Filter: open, in_progress, blocked, deferred, closed
  --all                     Include closed issues (default: excludes closed)
  --type <type>             Filter: bug, feature, task, epic
  --priority <0-4>          Filter by priority
  --assignee <name>         Filter by assignee
  --label <label>           Filter by label (repeatable)
  --parent=<id>             List children of parent
  --deferred                Show only deferred issues
  --defer-before <date>     Deferred before date
  --sort <field>            Sort by: priority, created, updated (default: priority)
                            (created/updated are shorthand for created_at/updated_at)
                            Tiebreaker: internal ULID (chronological creation order)
  --limit <n>               Limit results
  --count                   Output only the count of matching issues
  --long                    Show descriptions
  --pretty                  Tree format showing parent-child hierarchy
  --json                    Output as JSON
```

> **Default filtering:** By default, `tbd list` excludes closed issues to focus on
> active work. Use `--all` to include closed issues, or `--status closed` to show only
> closed issues.

**Sort order:** The primary sort is by the `--sort` field (default: priority ascending;
created/updated: newest first).
The tiebreaker for issues with equal primary values is the internal ULID, which sorts
lexicographically in chronological creation order.
This ensures deterministic, stable ordering—issues created earlier always appear before
issues created later within the same priority level.

**Examples:**

```bash
tbd list                             # Active issues only (excludes closed)
tbd list --all                       # All issues including closed
tbd list --status closed             # Only closed issues
tbd list --status open --priority=P1
tbd list --assignee agent-1 --json
tbd list --deferred
```

**Output (human-readable):**

```
ID          PRI  STATUS           TITLE
proj-a1b2   P1   ◐ in_progress    Fix authentication bug
proj-f14c   P2   ○ open           Add OAuth support
proj-c3d4   P3   ● blocked        Write API tests
```

**Output (--pretty):**

The `--pretty` flag displays issues in a tree format showing parent-child relationships.
Issues with children are shown with their children indented below them using tree
characters.

```
proj-1875  P1  ✓ closed  epic  Phase 24 Epic: Installation and Agent Integration
├── proj-1876  P1  ✓ closed  task  Implement tbd prime command
└── proj-1877  P1  ✓ closed  task  Implement tbd setup claude command
proj-a1b2  P1  ◐ in_progress  bug  Fix authentication bug
proj-f14c  P2  ○ open  feature  Add OAuth support
├── proj-c3d4  P2  ● blocked  task  Write OAuth tests
└── proj-e5f6  P2  ○ open  task  Update OAuth docs
```

**Pretty format columns (left to right):**

| Column | Color | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tree prefix | dim | `├── ` or `└── ` for children, with indentation for deeper levels |
| ID | cyan | Display ID (e.g., `proj-a1b2`) |
| Priority | P0=red, P1=yellow, P2+=default | Always with P prefix |
| Status | per status | Icon and word (e.g., `✓ closed`, `◐ in_progress`) |
| Type | dim | Issue kind (bug, feature, task, epic, chore) |
| Title | default | Issue title |

**Tree structure rules:**

- Issues without a parent appear at root level (no indentation)
- Children are grouped under their parent with tree lines
- `├── ` prefix for middle children
- `└── ` prefix for last child in a group
- Multi-level nesting uses additional indentation (`│ ` or ` `)
- Children sorted by priority within each parent group

**Output (--json):**

```json
[
  {
    "type": "is",
    "id": "is-a1b2",
    "title": "Fix authentication bug",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "priority": 1,
    "kind": "bug",
    "version": 3,
    "created_at": "2025-01-07T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-01-07T14:30:00Z"
  }
]
```

#### Show

```bash
tbd show <ids...> [options]

Options:
  --json                    Output as JSON instead of YAML+Markdown
  --show-order              Display child_order_hints (if any)
  --no-parent               Suppress automatic parent context display
  --max-lines <n>           Truncate output to N lines (per issue in bulk)
  --ignore-missing          Skip unknown IDs instead of failing
```

**Bulk reads (2+ IDs):** each issue renders under a dim `── <id> ──` delimiter in
argument order (duplicates render once), parent context is suppressed, `--max-lines`
applies per issue, and `--json` emits an array (a single ID keeps the object shape).
Unknown IDs fail the whole read listing every bad ID; `--ignore-missing` renders the
found subset, reports skips on stderr, and exits 0: the same validate-all/fail-closed
contract as the bulk mutators, with no lock taken (read-only).
In `--json` mode stdout stays parseable when everything is skipped: the bulk form emits
`[]` and the single-ID form emits `null`.

**Output:**

The `show` command outputs the issue in a storage-compatible format (YAML frontmatter +
Markdown body). This format is both human-readable and machine-parseable, enabling
round-trip editing workflows.
For dependency direction, text output may include YAML comments immediately above the
`dependencies` field:

```yaml
# Blocks: proj-c3d4
# Blocked by: proj-f14c
dependencies:
  - type: blocks
    target: is-c3d4...
```

These comments are ignored by `tbd update --from-file` and exist only to clarify the raw
edge list. In storage, `type: blocks` means the shown issue blocks the target.
For dependency-direction checks, prefer `tbd dep list <id>`, which renders the
human-facing `Blocks:` and `Blocked by:` sections directly.

**Parent context (auto-displayed for child issues):**

When the shown issue has a `parent_id`, the show command displays the requested issue
first, then appends the full parent issue (in the same YAML+Markdown format) below,
capped at `PARENT_CONTEXT_MAX_LINES` (default: 50) from `settings.ts`. This provides
essential context without requiring a separate lookup.

```
---
(child issue shown first)
---

The parent of this bead is:
---
id: is-a1b2c3
kind: epic
title: Build Auth System
status: in_progress
priority: 1
---
Users need OAuth, SAML, and API key authentication methods.
```

This means child issues do NOT need to duplicate the parent’s context in their own
description. When creating children under a parent epic, the parent’s description serves
as shared context that is always visible when viewing any child.

Use `--no-parent` to suppress this behavior (e.g., for scripting or piping).
For `--json` output, the parent issue data is included as a `parent` object.

**Output truncation (`--max-lines`):**

When `--max-lines <n>` is specified, the issue output is truncated to at most `n` lines.
If truncated, a dimmed omission notice is appended:

```
… [15 lines omitted]
```

This option is off by default for the main issue.
The parent context display always uses `PARENT_CONTEXT_MAX_LINES` (50) as its cap.

```markdown

## Notes

Working on session token expiry. Found issue in refresh logic.
```

Output is colorized when stdout is a TTY (see `--color` global option in §4.10).

**Round-trip editing workflow:**

```bash
# Export, edit, re-import
tbd show proj-a1b2 > issue.md
# ... edit issue.md ...
tbd update proj-a1b2 --from-file issue.md
```

> **Note:** The `notes` field appears as a `## Notes` section in the Markdown body,
> separated from the main description.
> Notes are intended for agent/developer working notes, while the description is the
> issue’s canonical description.

#### Update

```bash
tbd update <ids...> [options]

Options:
  --from-file <path>        Update all fields from YAML+Markdown file (single ID)
  --title <text>            Set title (single ID)
  --status <status>         Set status (single ID)
  --type <type>             Set type
  --priority <0-4>          Set priority
  --assignee <name>         Set assignee
  --description <text>      Set description ("-" reads stdin; single ID)
  --notes <text>            Set working notes ("-" reads stdin; single ID)
  --notes-file <path>       Set notes from file ("-" reads stdin; single ID)
  --due <date>              Set due date
  --defer <date>            Set deferred until date
  --add-label <label>       Add label
  --remove-label <label>    Remove label
  --parent=<id>             Set parent (single ID)
  --child-order <ids>       Set child ordering hints (comma-separated; single ID)
  --ignore-missing          Skip unknown IDs instead of failing (bulk)
```

With two or more IDs, only shared fields apply (`--type`, `--priority`, `--assignee`,
`--add-label`, `--remove-label`, `--due`, `--defer`); per-ID and lifecycle flags are
rejected. Use `tbd close`/`tbd reopen` for lifecycle changes.

**Examples:**

```bash
tbd update proj-a1b2 --status=in_progress
tbd update proj-a1b2 --title "New issue title"
tbd update proj-a1b2 --add-label urgent --priority=P0
tbd update proj-a1b2 --defer 2025-02-01

# Set child display ordering for a parent issue
tbd update proj-a1b2 --child-order proj-c3d4,proj-e5f6,proj-g7h8

# Round-trip editing: export, modify, re-import
tbd show proj-a1b2 > issue.md
# ... edit issue.md ...
tbd update proj-a1b2 --from-file issue.md
```

**`--from-file` behavior:**

- Reads the YAML frontmatter and Markdown body from file

- Validates against IssueSchema

- Updates all mutable fields (immutable fields `id`, `type`, `created_at`, `created_by`
  are preserved from existing issue)

- Automatically increments `version` and sets `updated_at`

- Reports clear validation errors if schema is invalid

#### Close

```bash
tbd close <ids...> [options]

Options:
  --reason <text>           Close reason ("-" reads stdin)
  --reason-file <path>      Read close reason from a file ("-" reads stdin)
  --ignore-missing          Skip unknown IDs instead of failing (bulk)
```

**Examples:**

```bash
tbd close proj-a1b2
tbd close proj-a1b2 --reason "Fixed in commit abc123"
tbd close proj-a1b2 proj-c3d4 proj-e5f6 --reason "Sprint complete"  # bulk, one lock
```

#### Reopen

```bash
tbd reopen <ids...> [options]

Options:
  --reason <text>           Reopen reason ("-" reads stdin)
  --reason-file <path>      Read reopen reason from a file ("-" reads stdin)
  --ignore-missing          Skip unknown IDs instead of failing (bulk)
```

#### Ready

List issues ready to work on (open, unblocked, unclaimed):

```bash
tbd ready [options]

Options:
  --type <type>             Filter by type
  --limit <n>               Limit results
  --json                    Output as JSON
```

**Algorithm:**

- Status = `open`

- No `assignee` set

- No blocking dependencies (where dependency.status != ‘closed’)

> **Performance note:** The `ready` command uses the query index when enabled to avoid
> loading all issues. Dependency target status is checked via index lookup.
> Without index, dependency targets are loaded on-demand.

#### Blocked

List blocked issues:

```bash
tbd blocked [options]

Options:
  --limit <n>               Limit results
  --json                    Output as JSON
```

**Output:**

```
ISSUE       TITLE                    BLOCKED BY
proj-c3d4     Write tests              proj-f14c (Add OAuth)
proj-e5f6     Deploy to prod           proj-a1b2, proj-c3d4
```

#### Stale

List issues not updated recently:

```bash
tbd stale [options]

Options:
  --days <n>                Days since last update (default: 7)
  --status <status>         Filter by status (default: open, in_progress)
  --limit <n>               Limit results
  --json                    Output as JSON
```

**Examples:**

```bash
tbd stale                    # Issues not updated in 7 days
tbd stale --days 14          # Issues not updated in 14 days
tbd stale --status blocked   # Blocked issues that are stale
```

**Output:**

```
ISSUE       DAYS  STATUS       TITLE
proj-a1b2     12    in_progress  Fix authentication bug
proj-f14c     9     open         Add OAuth support
```

### 4.5 Label Commands

```bash
# Add label to issue
tbd label add <id> <label>

# Remove label from issue
tbd label remove <id> <label>

# List all labels in use
tbd label list
```

**Examples:**

```bash
tbd label add proj-a1b2 urgent
tbd label remove proj-a1b2 low-priority
tbd label list
```

### 4.6 Dependency Commands

Dependencies use the semantics **“A depends on B”** (equivalent to **“B blocks A”**).
This matches Beads convention.

```bash
# Add dependencies: issue depends on each depends-on (each depends-on blocks issue).
# All IDs are validated before anything is written; one call wires several blockers.
tbd dep add <issue> <depends-on...>

# Remove dependencies
tbd dep remove <issue> <depends-on...>

# List dependencies for an issue
tbd dep list <id>

# Blockers can also be declared at creation:
tbd create "title" --depends-on <id> [--depends-on <id2>]
```

**Argument semantics:**

- `<issue>`: The issue that depends on something (the dependent/blocked issue)
- `<depends-on>`: The issue that must be completed first (the prerequisite/blocker)

**Examples:**

```bash
# "Write tests" depends on "Add OAuth" (can't write tests until OAuth is done)
tbd dep add proj-c3d4 proj-f14c
# Output: ✓ proj-c3d4 now depends on proj-f14c

# List what blocks/is blocked by an issue
tbd dep list proj-c3d4
# Output:
# Blocked by: proj-f14c
```

**Data model:** Dependencies are stored on the blocker issue with
`{type: 'blocks', target: blocked-issue-id}`. This enables efficient lookup of “what
does this issue block?”
from its own dependencies array.

**Note**: Currently only supports `blocks` dependency type.
Future: `related`, `discovered-from`.

### 4.7 Sync Commands

```bash
# Full sync (pull then push)
tbd sync

# Pull only
tbd sync --pull

# Push only
tbd sync --push

# Show sync status
tbd sync --status

# Force sync (overwrite conflicts)
tbd sync --force

# Repair worktree before syncing
tbd sync --fix
```

**Worktree Health Requirement:**

Before performing any sync operation, `tbd sync` MUST verify worktree health:

```typescript
async run(options: SyncOptions): Promise<void> {
  // FIRST: Ensure worktree exists and is healthy
  const worktreeStatus = await checkWorktreeHealth(tbdRoot);
  if (!worktreeStatus.healthy) {
    if (options.fix) {
      await this.repairWorktree(tbdRoot);
    } else {
      throw new WorktreeError(
        `Worktree is ${worktreeStatus.status}. ` +
        `Run 'tbd sync --fix' or 'tbd doctor --fix' to repair.`
      );
    }
  }

  // Now safe to resolve path - worktree guaranteed to exist
  this.dataSyncDir = await resolveDataSyncDir(tbdRoot);

  // ... rest of sync operations
}
```

**Path Consistency Invariant:** All sync operations MUST use the resolved `dataSyncDir`
path consistently.
Never mix `resolveDataSyncDir()` results with hardcoded `WORKTREE_DIR`
or `DATA_SYNC_DIR` constants.

**Output (sync):**

```
Pulled 3 issues, pushed 2 issues
No conflicts
```

**Output (sync --status):**

```
Local changes (not yet pushed):
  modified: is-a1b2.md
  new:      is-f14c.md

Remote changes (not yet pulled):
  modified: is-x1y2.md
```

**Output (sync with unhealthy worktree):**

```
Error: Worktree is missing. Run 'tbd sync --fix' or 'tbd doctor --fix' to repair.
```

### 4.8 Search Commands

tbd provides integrated search via the hidden worktree, enabling text search across all
issues. (The worktree also enables manual use of ripgrep/grep if needed.)

```bash
# Search issue content
tbd search <pattern> [options]

Options:
  --field <field>           Search only in specific field (title, description, notes, labels)
  --status <status>         Filter by status
  --case-sensitive          Case-sensitive search (default: case-insensitive)
  --limit <n>               Limit results
  --no-refresh              Skip worktree refresh
  --json                    JSON output

# Future options (not yet implemented):
#   --type <type>           Filter by issue type
#   --label <label>         Filter by label
#   --context <n>           Show n lines of context
#   --files-only            Only show matching file paths
#   --count                 Show match count only
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Basic search
tbd search "authentication"

# Search in specific field
tbd search "timeout" --field description

# Search open issues only
tbd search "TODO" --status open

# Limit results
tbd search "error" --limit 10
```

**Output (default):**

```
proj-a1b2: Fix authentication timeout
  description (line 5): ...users experiencing authentication timeout after 5 minutes...

proj-f14c: Add OAuth support
  notes (line 2): ...need to handle timeout during OAuth callback...

Found 2 issues with 2 matches
```

**Output (--json):**

```json
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "issue_id": "is-a1b2c3",
      "display_id": "proj-a1b2",

#### Implementation Notes

Search is currently implemented as an **in-memory scan**:

1. Load all issues from the hidden worktree directory
2. Filter issues by searching fields with string matching
3. Apply additional filters (status, type, label)

**Search algorithm:**

```
SEARCH(pattern, options):
  1. Ensure worktree is initialized and up-to-date
     - If stale (>5 minutes since last fetch), refresh: tbd sync --pull

  2. Load all issues from worktree into memory

  3. For each issue, search specified fields:
     - title, description, notes, labels (default: all)
     - Case-insensitive by default

  4. Apply additional filters (type, status, label)

  5. Format output according to options
```

**Worktree staleness:**

The search command checks worktree freshness.
If the worktree is stale (last fetch was more than 5 minutes ago), search will
automatically pull before searching to ensure results are current.
This can be disabled with `--no-refresh`.

> **Future Enhancement:** For improved performance on large repositories (10K+ issues),
> search could be optimized to use ripgrep (`rg`) against the worktree files directly.
> See §7.2 Future Enhancements for details.

```bash
# Search without refreshing (faster but potentially stale)
tbd search "pattern" --no-refresh
```

### 4.9 Maintenance Commands

#### Status

The `status` command is the “orientation” command—like `git status`, it works regardless
of initialization state and helps users understand where they are.

> **Note:** Unlike Beads where `bd status` is just an alias for `bd stats`, `tbd status`
> is a distinct command that provides system orientation, not issue statistics.
> Use `tbd stats` for issue counts.

```bash
tbd status [options]

Options:
  --json                    JSON output
```

#### Doctor

```bash
tbd doctor [options]

Options:
  --fix                     Auto-fix issues
  --json                    Output as JSON
```

**Checks performed:**

The doctor command performs comprehensive health checks organized into categories:

**1. Worktree Health Check**

| Check | Severity | Auto-fixable | Detection |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Worktree missing | error | yes | Directory doesn’t exist |
| Worktree prunable | error | yes | `git worktree list` shows prunable |
| Worktree corrupted | error | yes | Missing `.git` file or invalid gitdir |

**2. Sync Branch Health Check**

| Check | Severity | Auto-fixable | Detection |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local branch missing | error | yes | `refs/heads/tbd-sync` doesn’t exist |
| Remote branch missing | warning | no | `refs/remotes/origin/tbd-sync` doesn’t exist |
| Local/remote diverged | warning | no | `git merge-base` != either HEAD |

**3. Sync State Consistency Check**

Only runs if worktree is healthy:

| Check | Severity | Auto-fixable | Detection |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Worktree HEAD != local branch | error | yes | Different commit SHAs |
| Local ahead of remote | info | no | `git rev-list` count > 0 |
| Local behind remote | info | no | `git rev-list` count > 0 |

**4. Data Location Check**

| Check | Severity | Auto-fixable | Detection |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Issues in wrong location | error | yes | Files exist in `.tbd/data-sync/issues/` on main |
| Local data exists but remote empty | error | no | Worktree has issues, remote tbd-sync has none |

**5. Schema and Reference Checks**

| Check | Severity | Auto-fixable | Detection |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Schema version incompatible | error | no | `meta.yml` version > supported |
| Orphaned dependencies | warning | yes | Dependency target doesn’t exist |
| Duplicate IDs | error | yes | Multiple files with same short ID |
| Invalid references | warning | yes | `parent_id` points to missing issue |

**Example output:**

```
Checking tbd health...

✗ ERROR: Worktree is prunable
  Fix: Run `tbd doctor --fix` to repair

✗ ERROR: Found 951 issues in wrong location (.tbd/data-sync/)
  Fix: Run `tbd doctor --fix` to migrate to worktree

⚠ WARNING: Remote branch 'origin/tbd-sync' does not exist
  Fix: Run `tbd sync` to push local branch to remote

3 error(s), 1 warning(s), 0 info(s)

Run `tbd doctor --fix` to auto-fix 2 issue(s)
```

**`--fix` behavior:**

The `--fix` flag performs repairs in this order:

1. If worktree corrupted:
   - **Backup to
     `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/backups/corrupted-worktree-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`**
     (prevents data loss)
   - Remove the corrupted worktree directory
2. If worktree prunable: `git worktree prune`
3. If worktree missing (or was just removed):
   - If local tbd-sync exists:
     `git worktree add $GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/data-sync-worktree tbd-sync`
   - Else if remote exists: `git fetch && git worktree add ... tbd-sync`
   - Else: `git worktree add --orphan tbd-sync ...`
4. If data in wrong location (`.tbd/data-sync/`):
   - Backup to `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/backups/tbd-data-sync-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`
   - Copy to worktree
   - Commit in worktree
5. Rebuild ID mappings if corrupted
6. Remove orphaned dependency references

> **Note:** Migration and repair backups are stored under `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/backups/`
> (alongside the shared sync worktree, outside the working tree and never committed).
> Older clients may still have data in `.tbd/backups/`, which is kept gitignored for
> legacy compatibility but is no longer the active write location.
> Users can manually inspect backups in either location to recover any data that wasn’t
> committed before the worktree became corrupted.

#### Compact (Future)

```bash
tbd compact [options]

Options:
  --dry-run                 Show what would be compacted
  --keep-days <n>           Keep closed issues for n days (default: 90)
```

**Note**: All closed issues are kept.
Compaction is a future enhancement.

#### Config

```bash
tbd config show                    # Show all configuration
tbd config get <key>               # Get a configuration value
tbd config set <key> <value>       # Set a configuration value
```

**Examples:**

```bash
tbd config show
tbd config get display.id_prefix
tbd config set sync.remote upstream
tbd config set display.id_prefix cd
```

### 4.10 Global Options

Available on all commands:

```bash
--help                      Show help
--version                   Show version
--db <path>                 Custom .tbd directory path (Beads compat alias)
--dir <path>                Custom .tbd directory path (preferred)
--json                      JSON output
--color <when>              Colorize output: auto, always, never (default: auto)
--actor <name>              Override actor name (not yet implemented)
--dry-run                   Show what would be done without making changes
--verbose                   Enable verbose output
--quiet                     Suppress non-essential output
--debug                     Show internal IDs alongside public IDs for debugging
```

**Exit Codes:**

Exit codes are repo-wide and defined in one module, so shell and agent recipes can
branch on them without reading command source:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Operational error, including unexpected errors and failed health checks |
| 2 | Usage error: an invalid flag, argument, or selector |
| 3 | No matching change: `tbd changes` found none, or `tbd watch --timeout` elapsed (§4.14) |
| 130 | Interrupted by SIGINT (128 + 2) |

Code 3 is the only “nothing happened” signal, and it is distinct from both failure modes
on purpose: a recipe can retry exit 3 forever while still failing fast on exit 2.

**Color Output:**

The `--color` option controls ANSI color output consistently across all commands:

- `auto` (default): Enable colors when stdout is a TTY, disable when piped/redirected

- `always`: Force colors (useful for `less -R` or capturing colored output)

- `never`: Disable colors entirely

This follows the same convention as `git`, `ls`, `grep`, and other Unix tools.

**Actor Resolution Order:**

> **Implementation note:** The `--actor` flag and `TBD_ACTOR` environment variable are
> not yet implemented.
> Currently, actor defaults to git user.email or system username.
> Full actor system design is tracked as future work.

The actor name (used for `created_by` and recorded in sync commits) is resolved in this
order:

1. `--actor <name>` CLI flag (highest priority)—*not yet implemented*

2. `TBD_ACTOR` environment variable—*not yet implemented*

3. Git user.email from git config

4. System username and hostname (fallback)

Example: `TBD_ACTOR=claude-agent-1 tbd create "Fix bug"`

> **Note:** `--db` is retained for Beads compatibility.
> Prefer `--dir` for new usage.

**Agent/Automation Flags:**

These options enable automation in CI/CD pipelines and by AI agents:

- `--dry-run`: Shows what changes would be made without actually making them.
  Essential for verifying agent-planned operations before execution.

- `--verbose`: Enables detailed debug output to stderr.
  Useful for troubleshooting.

- `--quiet`: Suppresses informational messages.
  Only errors and JSON data are output.
  Combine with `--json` for pure machine-readable output.

Example agent workflow:

```bash
# CI pipeline: create issue with JSON output
CI=1 tbd create "Deploy failed" --kind bug --priority=P2 --json

# Agent: preview changes before committing
tbd update td-abc1 --status done --dry-run --json

# Batch script: close multiple issues
tbd close td-abc1 td-abc2 td-abc3 --quiet
```

### 4.11 Attic Commands

The attic preserves data lost in merge conflicts.
These commands enable inspection and recovery.

**Entry ID Format:**

Attic entries are identified by a composite ID derived from the entity, timestamp, and
field:

```
{entity-id}/{timestamp}_{field}

Examples:
  is-01hx5zzkbkactav9wevgemmvrz/2025-01-07T10-30-00Z_description
  is-01hx5zzkbkbctav9wevgemmvrz/2025-01-08T09-00-00Z_title
  is-01hx5zzkbkactav9wevgemmvrz/2025-01-07T11-45-00Z_full    # Full entity conflict (rare)
```

- **entity-id**: The issue ID (e.g., `is-a1b2c3`)

- **timestamp**: ISO8601 timestamp with colons replaced by hyphens (filesystem-safe)

- **field**: The field name that was overwritten, or `full` for complete entity
  conflicts

This format ensures unique, sortable entry IDs that can be easily parsed and allow
filtering by entity or time range.

```bash
# List attic entries
tbd attic list [options]

Options:
  --id <id>                 Filter by issue ID
  --field <field>           Filter by field name
  --since <date>            Entries since date
  --limit <n>               Limit results
  --json                    JSON output
```

**Output:**

```
TIMESTAMP                  ISSUE      FIELD        WINNER
2025-01-07T10:30:00Z      proj-a1b2    description  remote
2025-01-07T11:45:00Z      proj-a1b2    notes        local
2025-01-08T09:00:00Z      proj-f14c    title        remote
```

```bash
# Show attic entry details
tbd attic show <id> <timestamp> [options]

Options:
  --json                    JSON output
```

**Output:**

```
Attic Entry: 2025-01-07T10-30-00Z_description

Issue: proj-a1b2 (Fix authentication bug)
Field: description
Timestamp: 2025-01-07T10:30:00Z

Winner: remote (version 4)
Loser: local (version 3)

Lost value:
  Original description text that was overwritten...

Context:
  Local updated_at: 2025-01-07T10:25:00Z
  Remote updated_at: 2025-01-07T10:28:00Z
```

```bash
# Restore value from attic
tbd attic restore <id> <timestamp> [options]

Options:
  --dry-run                 Show what would be restored
```

**Example:**

```bash
# Preview restoration
tbd attic restore proj-a1b2 2025-01-07T10-30-00Z --dry-run

# Apply restoration (creates new version with restored value)
tbd attic restore proj-a1b2 2025-01-07T10-30-00Z
```

> **Note:** Restore creates a new version of the issue with the attic value applied to
> the specified field.
> The original winning value is preserved in a new attic entry, maintaining the “no data
> loss” invariant.

### 4.12 Output Formats

**Human-readable** (default):

- Aligned columns

- Relative timestamps ("2 hours ago")

- Color coding (if terminal supports)

**JSON** (`--json`):

- Complete entity objects

- Absolute ISO8601 timestamps

- Parseable by scripts

- `tbd changes` and `tbd watch` instead emit a versioned change report (§4.14.3)

* * *

### 4.13 Docs Commands

Operations on managed docs (see §2.9 for the data model) live under the noun-scoped
`tbd docs` group, alongside the existing per-kind readers (`tbd guidelines`,
`tbd shortcut`, `tbd template`, which serve forked copies transparently via lookup
precedence):

```bash
tbd docs fork [names...] [--kind] [--all] [--force] [--dry-run]   # copy into docs/tbd/
tbd docs unfork [names...] [--all] [--force]   # back to upstream; refuses to drop edits
tbd docs status [--json]                       # per-doc states + missing/local hints
tbd docs update [names...] [--merge|--keep-ours] [--dry-run]      # reconcile with upstream
tbd docs diff <name> [--base|--upstream]       # net fork / your changes / incoming
tbd docs list [--kind] [--json]                # cross-kind list with state markers
```

tbd has three deliberately separate update surfaces; they differ in scope, risk, and
failure mode, and doc updates are the only one that can merge and mutate tracked files:

| Command | Scope | Touches | Modifies tracked files? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tbd sync` | project data (issues) | sync worktree + `tbd-sync` branch; refreshes the doc cache and *reports* fork drift | never |
| `tbd setup --auto` | installation + integrations | skills, hooks, settings, `AGENTS.md`; invokes a docs-cache sync | only generated integration files |
| `tbd docs update` | forked docs | fork dir + bases + manifest (offline, against the cache) | **yes, the only doc command that does** |

Update semantics (the full decision table is unit-tested row by row): an unmodified
stale fork is replaced; a customized stale fork gets a `git merge-file` three-way merge
that applies automatically when clean; conflicts are skipped by default and listed with
the two explicit strategies: `--merge` (combine, standard conflict markers, sets the
`conflicted` flag until markers are resolved) and `--keep-ours` (keep the local content,
advance the fork point).
Forked files are git-tracked, so every applied update is reviewable in `git diff` and
revertible; git is the undo.

### 4.14 Change and Watch Commands

Two commands expose the observation path of §3.7. They share one selector grammar and
one report format, and neither mutates anything.

```bash
tbd changes --since <commit> [selectors] [--json]     # one-shot, local, pure diff
tbd watch <selector> [--since <commit>] [--json] \    # block until a matching change
  [--interval <seconds>] [--timeout <seconds>]
```

`tbd changes` answers “what moved since this commit?”
against the local sync branch.
`tbd watch` answers “tell me when something moves” against the remote sync branch.

Watch reports one change and exits rather than streaming.
That keeps the no-daemon property (§7.1, Decision 2), makes a wake composable with
ordinary process control (a shell loop, a background task, a spawned agent), and gives
the caller an explicit resume point instead of an open connection to babysit.
Delivery is therefore **at least once**: a caller that acts on a report and then dies
sees it again on restart, so worker actions must be idempotent.

#### 4.14.1 Baseline Commits

`--since <commit>` takes an ordinary Git commit-ish, resolved in the caller’s repository
with `git rev-parse --verify <commit>^{commit}`. Any spelling Git accepts works: a full
or abbreviated SHA, `tbd-sync~3`, or a tag.
It is not an issue ID, a timestamp, or a tbd-internal sequence number.

The baseline must lie on the sync branch’s history.
Both commands check `git merge-base --is-ancestor <since> <tip>` and fail when it does
not hold, so a commit from a working branch such as `main` is rejected.

The tip differs by command:

| Command | Tip | Freshness |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tbd changes` | `refs/heads/<sync.branch>` | local sync branch as of the last `tbd sync`; no fetch, and unsynced edits in the hidden worktree are invisible |
| `tbd watch` | remote tip fetched into a private ref | current remote state at the moment of the wake |

In practice a baseline comes from a previous report: every report carries the full
resolved `since` and `tip` commit IDs it used, and passing that `tip` back as `--since`
closes the gap between invocations.
Without a previous report, any sync-branch commit works, for example
`git rev-parse tbd-sync`.

A baseline is durable but not eternal.
If sync recovery rewrites the sync branch, a saved baseline stops being an ancestor of
the new tip; the command fails with that reason and the caller starts from a new
baseline.

#### 4.14.2 Selectors

| Selector | Kind | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--bead <ids...>` | static | one or more named beads |
| `--label <label>` | dynamic | beads carrying the label (repeatable, ANDed) |
| `--spec <path>` | dynamic | beads tracking a spec (filename or suffix match) |
| `--status <status>` | dynamic | beads in one status |
| `--ready` | dynamic, edge-triggered | beads newly entering the ready set |
| `--all` | dynamic | every bead |

`--all` cannot be combined with anything, and `--bead` cannot be combined with the
dynamic filters. `tbd changes` defaults to `--all`; `tbd watch` requires an explicit
selector, since an unqualified watch is almost never the intent.

Dynamic filters reuse the same predicates as `tbd list` and `tbd ready`, so a watch
cannot drift from the list it mirrors.
Matching rules:

- **Static.** IDs resolve against the snapshot and an unknown ID is an error, so a typo
  fails immediately instead of waiting forever.
  A watch without `--since` validates its IDs against the local sync branch at startup;
  with `--since` it validates against the union of both endpoints, which allows watching
  a bead that was deleted after the baseline.

- **Filters.** A bead is reported when it matches *before or after*, so entering and
  leaving the set both wake.

- **`--ready`.** A bead is reported only when it matches after and did not match before.
  Ready means open, unassigned, and free of open blockers, the same predicate
  `tbd ready` uses (§4.4).

#### 4.14.3 Change Report Format

Both commands emit the same document.
`--json` prints it verbatim; human output renders it.

```json
{
  "since": "3f2a…",
  "tip": "9c81…",
  "changes": [
    {
      "id": "proj-a7k2",
      "internal_id": "is-01hx5zzkbkactav9wevgemmvrz",
      "title": "API returns 500 on malformed input",
      "change": "updated",
      "fields": [{ "field": "status", "before": "open", "after": "in_progress" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

- Stability follows the same contract as every other `--json` surface (§5.6): fields are
  added, never removed or repurposed, so a consumer ignores what it does not recognize.
  The report is command output rather than repository state, so `tbd_format` (§2.7.4)
  does not describe it and there is no separate report version to check.

- Output is deterministic: changes sort by internal ID, and fields follow one fixed
  order. The field-order record is compile-time exhaustive, so adding a substantive
  `Issue` field is a type error until its report position is chosen.

- `change` is `created`, `updated`, or `deleted`. `fields` covers every substantive
  issue field; `id`, `type`, `version`, and `updated_at` are excluded as bookkeeping.

- `description` and `notes` changes additionally carry `hunks`, a line diff with three
  lines of context. Past a fixed edit-distance cutoff the hunks are replaced by
  `hunks_omitted: "complexity_limit"`; `before` and `after` remain complete, so a
  pathological rewrite costs detail rather than unbounded work.

#### 4.14.4 Watch Loop

1. Reclaim private refs left by dead watchers, then validate a static selection.
2. Read the remote tip with `ls-remote`. The baseline is `--since` when given, otherwise
   this first observed tip.
3. With `--since`, compare immediately, so a change that landed before startup is
   reported instead of missed.
4. Poll: sleep the interval (default 30 seconds, minimum 10), read the remote tip again,
   and continue when it is unchanged.
   When it moved, fetch into the private ref and build a report.
   An empty report means unrelated movement: advance the baseline to that tip and keep
   waiting. A non-empty report prints and exits 0.
5. `--timeout` exits 3, but only after one remote observation at or after the boundary,
   so a change landing exactly on the deadline is not dropped.
6. An established watch rides out consecutive failed polls and aborts on the fifth, so a
   brief outage does not kill an unattended worker.
   Startup failures are immediate, and a failure at the timeout boundary is an
   operational error rather than a silent timeout, since the two are not the same claim.

### 4.15 Local Web View

`tbd web` is an optional, foreground view of the local bead graph for people who need to
scan a large hierarchy visually.
It is a CLI-layer presentation over the same file, query, and statistics implementations
as the terminal commands; it does not introduce another repository model,
synchronization contract, or persistent service.

The interaction boundary is deliberate.
In an agent session, the human asks to see the beads and the agent starts
`tbd web --open`, reports the ready URL, and owns the long-running process.
Browser controls select and arrange data but never mutate it.
The human asks the agent for changes; the agent uses the same ordinary `tbd` mutation
commands it would use without a browser, and the live viewer reflects the resulting
local state. The server is therefore a presentation surface, not an editor or an
alternate agent API.

```bash
tbd web [path] [--port <n>] [--open]
```

The optional path is a repository or any subdirectory within it and is resolved from the
caller’s current directory to a canonical repository root before startup.
Omitting it preserves the normal current-directory discovery contract.
An initialized repository with no beads is a valid empty snapshot.
Missing/non-directory paths are usage errors; existing paths without tbd metadata flow
through the shared `requireInit` error path so `web` does not invent a different
repository contract.

The server binds only `127.0.0.1`. With no explicit port it searches the bounded range
7777–7786; `--port` pins one port, and `--open` launches a browser only after an HTTP
readiness probe succeeds.
The command stays in the foreground and exits when interrupted; no daemon or background
state remains.

Board queries run against one in-memory snapshot and call the shared `selectIssues` and
`describeQuery` functions.
Responses include the equivalent CLI invocation and carry light rows only; descriptions
and notes are fetched per bead when expanded.
Ready retains one definition on every surface: open, unassigned, and without an open
blocker. The checkbox selects that exact `tbd ready` set.
Rows expose the derived state as quiet unboxed text after their real labels; it is
useful scan information, but is neither a lifecycle status nor a user label and must not
be styled as either.
The response carries conditional Status, Type, and Priority facets plus at most 32 label
facets per response.
An empty label search returns the highest-ranked choices; a search queries the complete
label vocabulary before applying the response cap, so every label remains reachable.
While the search field owns focus, its live draft remains authoritative across observer
and request renders until the debounce publishes it.
Home and End retain native caret movement there; the same keys navigate to the first and
last choices only when focus is elsewhere in the menu.
Every tally applies search and all other active dimensions; unselected zero-count values
are omitted.
Label candidates additionally apply every selected label, retaining selected
values for removal and preserving the CLI’s repeated-label AND semantics.
The client clamps collapsed titles at four lines, renders sans relative update ages with
exact literal tooltips, and exposes every data column as an ordered sort key.
The default is Pretty with Updated descending then Priority ascending.
The newest clicked key is primary, only the prior primary remains as a tie-breaker, and
sorting never clears Pretty.
In Pretty, the stack orders only outermost visible parent groups; Updated compares the
maximum timestamp across each entire visible subtree for every parent kind, while
children retain `child_order_hints` order and its deterministic fallback.
The browser deliberately uses a simpler visual grammar than terminal tree output: every
non-root row has exactly one `└──` elbow at its hierarchy indentation, with spaces for
ancestor levels and no tee or vertical-bar variants.
Flat mode applies the stack globally.
Reset restores the default sort stack without changing Pretty.
Because browser ordering is not an exact CLI filter, the response supplies a concise
ordering caveat beside the equivalent command.
Pretty never reinserts a bead excluded by Status, labels, search, or another filter; a
matching descendant whose parent is absent becomes a root, exactly as in
`tbd list --pretty`.

Expanded updated beads show field deltas with an 80-character middle-ellipsis preview
per scalar side. Copy preserves the bounded full values, before is muted historical
context, and after uses normal text.
Created beads omit null-to-current-value deltas as redundant with the expanded body.
The client delegates row expansion to one table-body listener and ignores clicks that
finish a non-collapsed text selection.
Each render restores keyboard focus by stable bead ID and control role, or by label
value inside the chooser.
A failed board refresh keeps the last successful rows visible and changes the persistent
observer indicator to an error state until a successful response clears it.
Render completion also dismisses any tooltip whose anchor was replaced.
These component and semantic rules are maintained in the co-located design-system
inventory in `src/web/styles.css`. Status-panel field names use standard-size sans
chrome and literal values use standard-size monospace; neither side shrinks merely
because the panel is narrow.
Liveness is strictly local.
A recursive Node `fs.watch` over the hidden data-sync worktree maps to native
operating-system notifications on supported local filesystems.
Events are trailing-debounced and trigger one serialized snapshot reload.
A one-second, constant-size reconciliation marker covers the issue directory, mapping
directory, project config, workspace metadata, and local sync-branch ref.
It reloads only when metadata changes, so an unchanged tick never scans or parses the
issue graph. If native watching is unavailable, the marker is the fallback; if marker
reads fail, native events continue.
The UI reports the active mode and enters an error state only when neither path works or
a reload fails.

`tbd web` never calls the remote-watch or sync implementation and never fetches, merges,
or pushes.
Remote exchange remains the explicit `tbd sync` contract used everywhere else.
When that command changes the shared hidden worktree, the same local observer redraws
the page immediately.
This keeps CLI and browser semantics identical and makes offline use predictable.

#### Concurrency and Snapshot Safety

`tbd web` has no worker threads: one Node.js event loop serializes its in-process
mutations. That fact alone is not a safety argument.
Other `tbd` processes can mutate the shared worktree while the viewer is suspended at
any `await`, and filesystem, timer, HTTP, and promise callbacks can arrive in any order.
The required safety property is:

> Every HTTP response and SSE state describes one complete accepted local snapshot.
> A response may briefly be the complete state before or after a write, but never a
> mixture assembled during that write.
> After a standard writer completes its protocol and writes stop, every connected client
> with at least one functioning observation path converges to the newest accepted
> snapshot.

The design establishes that property with these owners and serialization points:

| State | Owner | Serialization rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared data-sync files | Standard `tbd` writers | Repository writer mutex plus persistent write epoch |
| Accepted server snapshot | `BoardState` | FIFO candidate reads and one synchronous publication step |
| Reload scheduling | `LocalObserver` | One active reload plus one coalesced pending request |
| SSE clients/history | `SseHub` | Synchronous mutation with a bounded client set, per-client queue, and replay ring |
| Browser state | One client store | Monotonic observer versions, one board loop, and cancellable detail generations |

The proof is compact: every supported writer is mutually exclusive and brackets all
shared mutations with one persistent unique epoch; a reader publishes only after seeing
the same quiescent epoch, absent mutex, stable context, and stable marker on both sides
of a strictly validated private candidate.
That final fence is the read linearization point.
Publication has no `await`, observer triggers collapse to one active plus one pending
reload, and server/client versions reject late transport results.
Consequently callbacks may be duplicated, dropped, or reordered, but they can only delay
convergence or cause redundant work: they cannot publish a torn snapshot, roll state
backward, or create concurrent writers.
All waits flow writer lock to mapping lock, never through the viewer or a client, so the
wait graph has no cycle; every queue, retry, and client set is bounded.

**Cross-process snapshot fence.** The shared writer mutex prevents two standard writers
from overlapping. It does not by itself protect a non-locking reader: a complete writer
could acquire and release the transient lock between two reader checks.
Therefore the central shared-lock wrapper also maintains an atomically replaced
persistent epoch in the Git common-dir tbd state.
On lock acquisition it writes `active:<unique-id>` before the critical section; while
still holding the lock it writes `quiescent:<same-unique-id>` after the critical
section, then releases the lock.
Before contending, a writer prepares a complete, non-empty owner-generation directory
containing a unique token, the host, and the process id.
The established atomic `mkdir` remains the sole lock election.
Its winner renames the prepared generation to `lock/owner` before entering the critical
section. This uses the same portable same-filesystem directory-rename primitive already
required for release and stale recovery, not hard links or a second lock mechanism.
Because an installed owner generation is non-empty, a delayed installer cannot replace a
successor’s generation on macOS, Linux, or Windows.
Owner-record open or write failure therefore occurs before the canonical directory
exists; a failed install removes only an empty provisional directory.
Immediately after winning `mkdir`, the contender records the provisional directory’s
filesystem identity (`dev`, `ino`). If owner installation reports failure, it first
checks for ambiguous success by comparing the installed owner token, then verifies that
its token-private prepared generation still exists and compares the canonical identity.
If the canonical reservation vanished or changed, stale recovery or another contender
made concrete progress; the contender does no cleanup and retries.
If the same reservation remains, it attempts only `rmdir` cleanup and surfaces an
unexpected error unchanged.
A last-instant path replacement can therefore make another empty contender retry, but
`rmdir` cannot remove its non-empty installed owner generation.
This state-based classification covers macOS reporting `EINVAL` when an empty parent is
removed during `rename`, without treating a persistent same-generation `EINVAL` or
permission failure as contention.
Directory identity is only a retry/liveness discriminator: an unavailable or
conservatively equal identity can make acquisition fail, but the installed owner token
and non-empty generation still enforce mutual exclusion.
No filesystem handle or mutex is held across these checks.
The shared-data wrapper recognizes permission failures at the canonical lock,
token-private preparation, and nested owner-install paths, while permission errors from
the caller’s critical section pass through unchanged.
The doctor writability check exercises this same complete lifecycle at a unique probe
path rather than testing only the canonical `mkdir`. A crash in the remaining brief
`mkdir`-to-install window leaves no active critical section.
The empty reservation is recoverable after the stale threshold by `rmdir`, which also
preserves the historical mkdir-only recovery contract; a fresh ownerless or non-empty
unrecognized generation fails closed.
A best-effort heartbeat remains well below the stale threshold, but time alone is not
permission to evict a recognized owner.
A stale recognized same-host lock is recoverable only after the OS says its process no
longer exists; an alive, permission-ambiguous, remote-host, or non-empty unrecognized
owner fails closed and is left in place.
This matters after machine sleep or a long event-loop suspension: delayed heartbeats may
reduce liveness, but cannot turn two live writers into concurrent owners.
Heartbeat timestamp or read failure disables that advisory optimization for the current
generation; it does not poison the lease.
Commit and release re-read the unique owner record directly, while same-host process
liveness continues to prevent eviction.

Recovery renames a dead lock to a non-empty quarantine path derived from its unique
owner token and deliberately retains that tombstone.
If several waiters observed the same dead generation, only the first rename can succeed;
a delayed waiter cannot rename a successor into the already-occupied quarantine path.
This removes the canonical-path ABA race without a timing assumption.
Legacy ownerless locks remain outside the strengthened token/PID proof.
They retain the historical behavior: only a stale directory that is still empty can be
removed; a non-empty unrecognized generation requires explicit operator recovery.
Ownership is checked around quiescent publication and again at release, so loss is
surfaced and a displaced holder cannot publish success or delete its successor.
Normal release first renames the verified generation out of the canonical path and only
then removes its owner record, so a transient cleanup failure leaves a harmless sidecar
rather than an ownerless lock that blocks every later writer.
The reader’s independent lock check additionally prevents it from accepting a transient
epoch while a recognized owner is active.
This is a seqlock-style fence, not a polling signal.
A crashed writer leaves an active epoch, so readers remain on their last accepted
snapshot until a later locked preparation or writer establishes a new quiescent epoch.
Updating the central lock wrapper covers create, update, import, and `tbd sync` without
giving the web command a second mutation implementation.

Before the listener or observer exists, startup acquires that wrapper once to
initialize, migrate, or repair the layout and to establish a quiescent epoch.
It owns no HTTP, watcher, timer, or SSE resource while it can wait for the writer lock.
The long-running viewer never acquires or waits for that lock, so it cannot delay a CLI
writer or join a cross-process lock cycle.

**Optimistic read transaction.** `BoardState.reload` serializes reloads FIFO and stages
all work in private variables.
It reads a first epoch and requires it to be quiescent, confirms the mutex is absent,
loads context and all issue files, and strictly validates the candidate: directory-read,
parse, filename/ID, mapping, and context errors reject the entire candidate rather than
silently omitting rows.
It then reads the epoch and mutex again.
Publication is allowed only when the second epoch is the identical quiescent value and
the mutex is still absent.
Configuration is atomically replaced; loading and comparing context on both sides of the
candidate prevents a configuration or mapping change from being combined with paths
interpreted under another context.
The constant-size reconciliation marker remains useful for missed-event detection and as
an additional instability check.
It combines filesystem metadata with the bounded epoch token, so a fast complete writer
is still visible on filesystems with coarse timestamps; the epoch equality check, not
timestamps, is the transaction proof.

The final successful fence check is the read transaction’s linearization point.
A writer that overlaps any candidate read leaves the lock active, an active epoch, or a
different final epoch.
A writer that starts afterward can make the accepted snapshot old, but cannot make it
torn. `BoardState` then computes movement and replaces context, indexes, rows, and
summary state in one synchronous segment containing no `await`. Request handlers also
copy the accepted board and its observer state without an intervening `await`;
JavaScript run-to-completion therefore exposes either the complete old snapshot or the
complete new one. Rejected candidates do not mutate served state or advance the
observer’s reconciliation marker.
They leave one bounded retry.
Initial load applies the same rule for at most ten seconds and fails instead of serving
an empty or mixed board.

The fence proof covers current standard `tbd` writers.
Atomic single-file configuration replacement is independently safe, and diagnostic
Git/workspace fields may be from an earlier or later instant without changing bead-graph
consistency.
A process or older binary that bypasses the shared writer wrapper is outside
the guarantee; supporting it would require that writer to adopt the same epoch protocol.
The epoch detects overlapping mutation; it does not add rollback to a CLI command.
After a command returns an error, storage-valid files it deliberately completed are
stable local state, while malformed or missing candidate data fails closed.
A process suspended longer than the lock’s stale threshold remains the owner while its
same-host pid is alive; the protocol chooses safety over automatically recovering a hung
process. PID reuse or an owner on another host can therefore delay progress, but cannot
create concurrent writers.
Automatic recovery assumes the owner and waiter share the supported local worktree’s OS
PID namespace. A different host identity fails closed; deployments that deliberately
share one worktree across PID namespaces are outside automatic recovery and require
operator verification.
If a process exits while its epoch is active, a later writer may quarantine that dead
generation after the stale threshold and establish a new quiescent epoch.
Ambiguous or legacy lock state intentionally fails closed and requires the operator to
verify that no writer remains before removing it.

**Observation and publication.** Filesystem events are wake-up hints, not an ordered
change log. Native events use a 250 ms trailing debounce; a one-second constant-size
metadata check repairs missed or coalesced events.
While a reload is active, arbitrarily many triggers collapse into one pending request,
which runs immediately afterward.
There is no event-count promise queue.
Movement is derived only from the two accepted `id:version` and display-ID snapshots, so
duplicate, missing, and reordered events are harmless.
Several completed writes inside one debounce window intentionally produce one aggregate
transition from the last accepted state to the newest state.

**Transport and browser ordering.** Publication is state convergence, not exactly-once
event delivery. `stateVersion` increases for every publication, `dataVersion` only for
accepted graph movement, and a fresh `observerId` starts a new ordering epoch after
restart. SSE close/error handlers and client membership are installed before the first
frame. Reconnect replay is a bounded chronological suffix ending in current state; a
slow, closed, or over-budget client is removed without blocking any other client.

The browser opens SSE before its initial board request.
It rejects duplicate or older versions from the same observer, accepts a restarted
observer’s lower counters, and lets a canonical board response replace a bounded SSE
summary at the same version.
One coalescing refresh loop aborts superseded board requests.
Detail requests are capped at eight and carry both a graph generation and a per-request
token; collapse, graph motion, or shutdown aborts them, and a late success or failure
cannot populate the current cache.
Thus transport duplication or response reordering can cause an extra fetch, but cannot
roll back adopted state or create duplicate rows.

**Shutdown and progress.** Shutdown stores one idempotent promise, marks the observer
stopped before closing the watcher, cancels debounce/retry/reconciliation timers, and
clears the pending slot.
Completion callbacks check `stopped` after every `await`, so in-flight reads cannot
publish late.
The server unsubscribes first, allows the one active reload a bounded grace
period, then closes SSE clients and HTTP connections; work that outlives the grace
period is harmless because publication is fenced off.
Every queue and buffer has an explicit bound, and retries are timer-driven rather than
busy loops; the connection cap also bounds aggregate fan-out work.
Since the live viewer takes no writer lock, writers wait for no viewer resource, SSE
fan-out waits for no client, and shutdown waits for no writer, the wait graph is acyclic
and has no deadlock path.
Within writer processes the only nested data lock order is repository lock, then the
append-only mapping-file lock; no standard path acquires them in reverse order.

These cases are the compact proof obligation and the required adversarial test matrix:

| Interleaving | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| Writer is active, or starts/finishes during a candidate read | Epoch/lock validation rejects the candidate; old accepted state remains served |
| Live lock crosses stale windows, including machine sleep | PID liveness prevents eviction; the second writer waits or times out and no overlap occurs |
| Owner-record preparation or installation fails | Preparation fails before canonical acquisition; installation cleanup removes only an empty provisional reservation and never overwrites a successor |
| Empty reservation is removed while owner rename is in flight, including macOS `EINVAL` | Changed directory identity proves generation movement; the private owner source remains intact, no cleanup is attempted against the observed replacement, and acquisition retries. The same error against the same generation is surfaced instead of spun |
| Hard links are unsupported | The established mkdir election plus same-filesystem directory rename still acquires; no hard-link syscall is used |
| Stale ownerless lock is unexpectedly non-empty | Empty-only recovery makes no progress and the contender waits on its bounded polling cadence; it neither removes unknown data nor spins |
| Prepared owner generation disappears during install | Empty-only cleanup preserves any successor, then acquisition fails immediately because retry cannot make progress without its token-private source |
| Owner preparation or installation is not writable | The shared writer reports the actionable shared-lock error, doctor reproduces the complete lifecycle, and an unrelated critical-section permission error is not relabeled |
| Dead-generation quarantine is already occupied | No canonical generation moves and the contender waits on its bounded polling cadence; retained data and mutual exclusion remain intact |
| Heartbeat metadata update fails while ownership remains valid | The direct owner fence still quiesces and releases the generation; no active epoch or canonical lock is stranded |
| Several waiters retain one stale observation while a successor acquires | One owner-token quarantine wins; its retained tombstone makes every delayed rename fail without touching the successor |
| Candidate issue, mapping, or epoch data is unreadable, corrupt, or oversized | The entire candidate fails closed; no empty or partial substitute is published |
| Native and reconciliation callbacks overlap or repeat | One active plus one pending reload; final accepted state is published once as an aggregate transition |
| SSE attach/close races with publication, or connection capacity is exhausted | Handlers exist before frames; current state is included; only that client is dropped or rejected |
| Board/detail response completes after newer state or controls | Abort plus observer/version/generation checks discard it |
| Shutdown occurs at every `await` boundary | No post-stop publication, no retained timer/watcher/client, and bounded server close |

After a standard writer quiesces, native notification normally starts convergence after
250 ms; if that hint is lost, the next one-second reconciliation check does.
Reload time is additional and scales with the local issue count.
The contract deliberately does not promise one animation per filesystem event or remote
liveness: only explicit `tbd sync` changes remote state, and its locally committed
result follows this same path.

The client opens its event stream before its first board fetch, coalesces refreshes, and
bounds concurrent detail requests.
Each observer process has a fresh instance id and a monotonic state version, so the
client rejects stale metadata even when the bead graph version is unchanged, accepts the
canonical board state at the same version after a bounded event frame, and accepts a
restarted observer’s lower counters.
A delayed duplicate event at an already-adopted version cannot replace that canonical
state. Board responses carry at most 10,000 light rows and retain the full match count
when truncated. Pretty never bypasses filters by serializing ancestors as extra context.
The browser renders those rows in 5,000-row pages, exposes sticky and end-of-page
navigation, and allows bulk detail expansion only when 100 rows or fewer are visible on
the page. This threshold is empirical rather than round-number preference: a production
Chromium stress page measured 93,323 elements and 1.71–2.55 seconds at 5,000 rows,
versus 186,380 elements and 2.81–5.50 seconds at 10,000. The former is a usable
last-resort page; the latter adds substantial layout and garbage-collection variance.
At most 100 details remain expanded, the body cache retains 200 entries, and a mass
deletion animates at most 100 ghost rows.
Changed and removed row ids remain complete in the canonical board state for the latest
graph movement; a bounded event frame is only the notification that causes the client to
fetch that state.
Field-level before/after detail is diagnostic and separately bounded to
100 changed beads and 256 KiB, with oversized values summarized rather than retained in
the board state. These are separate resource bounds: the response ceiling supports
unusually large projects, while the render, expansion, cache, and motion ceilings keep
DOM layout, memory, and detail-request work responsive.

Version 1 is intentionally read-only: the HTTP router has no mutation endpoint.
It accepts only `GET`, validates loopback Host and same-origin Origin headers, serves a
self-contained page under a restrictive Content Security Policy, caps event frames and
replay buffers, and applies an explicit queued-byte ceiling per client before dropping a
slow connection. An ended stream or write-time close race drops only that client rather
than escaping a publish or heartbeat into the process.
It closes streams during bounded signal shutdown.
A remotely reachable or writable interface remains a separate design with its own
authentication, concurrency, and security review.

## 5. Beads Compatibility

### 5.1 Import Strategy

The import command is designed to be **idempotent and safe to re-run**. This enables
workflows where:

- Initial migration from Beads to tbd

- Ongoing sync if some agents still use Beads temporarily

- Recovery if work was accidentally done in Beads

#### 5.1.1 Import Command

The import command supports two modes: **explicit file** and **repository auto-detect**.

```bash
# Mode 1: Explicit file (e.g., from `bd export`)
tbd import <file> [options]

# Mode 2: Auto-detect from Beads repository
tbd import --from-beads [path] [options]

Options:
  --format beads          Import format (default: beads)
  --from-beads [path]     Auto-detect from .beads/ directory (default: current dir)
  --branch <name>         Specific branch to import from (default: both main + sync)
  --dry-run               Show what would be imported without making changes
  --verbose               Show detailed import progress
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Explicit file import (recommended for controlled migration)
bd export > beads-export.jsonl
tbd import beads-export.jsonl

# Re-import after more Beads work (safe to re-run)
bd export > beads-export.jsonl
tbd import beads-export.jsonl  # Updates existing, adds new, no duplicates

# Preview changes before importing
tbd import beads-export.jsonl --dry-run

# Auto-detect from repository (imports from both main and sync branch)
tbd import --from-beads

# Auto-detect from specific path
tbd import --from-beads /path/to/repo

# Import only from main branch
tbd import --from-beads --branch main

# Import only from sync branch
tbd import --from-beads --branch beads-sync
```

**Auto-initialization with `--from-beads`:**

When using `--from-beads` in a repository that has not been initialized with `tbd init`,
the import command will automatically initialize tbd first.
This enables a one-step migration workflow:

```bash
# One-step migration (no prior tbd init needed)
tbd import --from-beads
# Output: "Initialized tbd and imported 142 issues from Beads"
```

This auto-initialization only applies to `--from-beads` mode.
Explicit file import (`tbd import <file>`) still requires prior initialization with
`tbd init`. See §4.1.1 for full initialization requirements.

#### 5.1.2 Multi-Source Import (--from-beads)

When using `--from-beads`, tbd reads directly from the Beads repository structure
instead of an exported file.
This is useful when you want to import without running `bd export` first, or when you
need to capture changes from both main and sync branches.

**Beads Repository Structure:**

Beads stores issues in two potential locations that may contain different data:

```
.beads/
├── issues.jsonl          # JSONL on current branch (may be main or feature branch)
├── beads.db              # SQLite cache (gitignored, not imported)
└── config.yml           # Contains sync.branch setting

# If sync.branch is configured (e.g., "beads-sync"):
# The sync branch also has .beads/issues.jsonl
```

**Why both branches matter:**

1. **Sync branch** (`beads-sync`): Where daemon commits changes automatically

2. **Main branch**: Where sync branch is periodically merged

These can diverge when:

- Daemon has committed to sync branch but not yet pushed/merged to main

- Agent work happened on sync branch after last merge to main

- Different machines have committed to different branches

**Auto-Detection Algorithm:**

```
DETECT_BEADS_SOURCES(path):
  1. Find .beads/ directory at path (or current directory)
  2. Read .beads/config.yaml to get sync.branch setting
  3. Collect JSONL sources:

     sources = []

     # Check current branch / working directory
     if exists(.beads/issues.jsonl):
       sources.append({
         branch: "working-copy",
         path: .beads/issues.jsonl
       })

     # Check main branch (via git show)
     main_branch = detect_default_branch()  # main or master
     if git_file_exists(main_branch, ".beads/issues.jsonl"):
       sources.append({
         branch: main_branch,
         content: git_show(main_branch + ":.beads/issues.jsonl")
       })

     # Check sync branch if configured
     if sync_branch = config.yaml["sync.branch"]:
       if git_file_exists(sync_branch, ".beads/issues.jsonl"):
         sources.append({
           branch: sync_branch,
           content: git_show(sync_branch + ":.beads/issues.jsonl")
         })

  4. Return sources (may be 1-3 depending on configuration)
```

**Reading from Git Branches Without Checkout:**

```bash
# Read JSONL from a specific branch without checking it out
git show beads-sync:.beads/issues.jsonl

# Check if file exists on branch
git cat-file -e beads-sync:.beads/issues.jsonl 2>/dev/null && echo "exists"
```

#### 5.1.3 Multi-Source Merge Algorithm

When importing from multiple sources (e.g., main and sync branches), issues are merged
using **Last-Write-Wins (LWW)** based on `updated_at` timestamp, matching Beads’ own
merge behavior.

```
MERGE_JSONL_SOURCES(sources):
  merged = {}  # beads_id -> issue

  for source in sources:
    for line in source.content:
      issue = parse_json(line)
      beads_id = issue.id

      if beads_id not in merged:
        # First occurrence
        merged[beads_id] = issue
        merged[beads_id]._source = source.branch
      else:
        existing = merged[beads_id]
        # LWW: newer updated_at wins
        if issue.updated_at > existing.updated_at:
          merged[beads_id] = issue
          merged[beads_id]._source = source.branch
        # If timestamps equal, prefer sync branch over main
        # (sync branch has the "true" latest state)
        elif issue.updated_at == existing.updated_at:
          if source.branch == sync_branch:
            merged[beads_id] = issue
            merged[beads_id]._source = source.branch

  return merged.values()
```

**Priority Order (when timestamps are equal):**

1. Sync branch (most authoritative for Beads data)

2. Working copy (uncommitted changes)

3. Main branch (last merged state)

**Attic preservation during import:** When multiple sources have conflicting values for
the same Beads issue, the losing version is preserved in the attic with source
information. This maintains the “no data loss” invariant even during import merges.

**Example Scenario:**

```
Main branch .beads/issues.jsonl:
  bd-a1b2: title="Fix bug", updated_at="2025-01-10T10:00:00Z"
  bd-c3d4: title="Add feature", updated_at="2025-01-09T08:00:00Z"

Sync branch .beads/issues.jsonl:
  bd-a1b2: title="Fix bug (WIP)", updated_at="2025-01-10T14:00:00Z"  # Newer!
  bd-c3d4: title="Add feature", updated_at="2025-01-09T08:00:00Z"    # Same
  bd-e5f6: title="New task", updated_at="2025-01-10T12:00:00Z"       # New!

Merged result:
  bd-a1b2: title="Fix bug (WIP)" (from sync, newer)
  bd-c3d4: title="Add feature" (from sync, same timestamp, sync preferred)
  bd-e5f6: title="New task" (from sync, only exists there)
```

**Import Output with Multi-Source:**

```bash
$ tbd import --from-beads --verbose

#### 5.1.4 ID Mapping and Preservation

The key to idempotent import is **stable ID mapping with ID preservation**. Imported
issues retain their original short IDs, ensuring:

- The same Beads issue always maps to the same tbd issue
- Users don’t need to learn new IDs after migration
- Commit messages, documentation, and external references remain valid

**ID preservation algorithm:**

When importing `tbd-100`, extract the short part (`100`) and use it directly:

```
Beads ID:       tbd-100
Short ID:       100        (extracted, preserved)
Internal ID:    is-01hx5zzkbkactav9wevgemmvrz  (generated ULID)
Display ID:     bd-100     (or tbd-100 with display.id_prefix: tbd)
```

**Mapping storage:**

All short IDs (imported and new) are stored in the unified mapping file:

```yaml
# .tbd/data-sync/mappings/ids.yml
# Imported issues preserve original short IDs:
100: 01hx5zzkbkactav9wevgemmvrz # was tbd-100
101: 01hx5zzkbkbctav9wevgemmvrz # was tbd-101
1823: 01hx5zzkbkcdtav9wevgemmvrz # was tbd-1823
# New issues get random 4-char base36:
a7k2: 01hx5zzkbkdetav9wevgemmvrz
```

**No separate beads.yml needed:** Since the original short ID is preserved in `ids.yml`,
there’s no need for a separate mapping file.
The `extensions.beads` field stores metadata about the import for debugging:

```yaml
extensions:
  beads:
    original_id: tbd-100 # Full original ID (for reference)
    imported_at: 2025-01-10T10:00:00Z
```

**Properties:**

- **ID preserved**: `tbd-100` becomes `bd-100` (same short ID, configurable prefix)
- **Synced**: Mapping file lives on sync branch, shared across all machines
- **Immutable entries**: Once a short ID is mapped, it never changes
- **Collision handling**: If a short ID already exists (rare), skip import of that issue
  and warn—this indicates the issue was already imported

**Mapping recovery:** If `ids.yml` is corrupted or lost, it can be reconstructed by
scanning all issue files.
Each issue’s internal ID provides the ULID, and the `extensions.beads.original_id`
provides the short ID for imported issues.
Run `tbd doctor --fix` to rebuild.

#### 5.1.5 Import Algorithm

```
IMPORT_BEADS(jsonl_file):
  1. Load existing ID mapping from .tbd/data-sync/mappings/ids.yml
     (create empty {} if not exists)

  2. For each line in jsonl_file:
     a. Parse Beads issue JSON
     b. beads_id = issue.id (e.g., "tbd-100")
     c. short_id = extract_short_id(beads_id)  # "100" from "tbd-100"

     d. Look up short_id in id_mapping:
        - If found: This issue was already imported
          tbd_id = "is-" + id_mapping[short_id]
          Load existing tbd issue for merge
        - If not found: New import
          tbd_id = generate_new_ulid("is-")
          Add id_mapping[short_id] = tbd_id.ulid_part
          # Preserves original short ID!

     e. Convert Beads fields to tbd format (see Field Mapping)

     f. Set extensions.beads.original_id = beads_id
        Set extensions.beads.imported_at = now()

     g. If existing tbd issue:
        - Compare updated_at timestamps
        - If Beads is newer: apply merge using standard rules
        - If tbd is newer: skip (tbd changes preserved)
        - If same: no-op (already imported)
     h. If new issue:
        - Write new tbd issue file

  3. Save updated ids.yml mapping file

  4. Report: N new, M updated, K unchanged, J skipped (tbd newer)

  5. Stage locally (publish later with `tbd sync`)

extract_short_id(beads_id):
  # "tbd-100" → "100"
  # "bd-a1b2" → "a1b2"
  return beads_id.replace(/^[a-z]+-/, "")
```

#### 5.1.6 Merge Behavior on Re-Import

When re-importing an issue that already exists in tbd:

| Scenario | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Beads unchanged, tbd unchanged | No-op |
| Beads updated, tbd unchanged | Update tbd with Beads changes |
| Beads unchanged, tbd updated | Keep tbd changes (skip) |
| Both updated | Merge using LWW rules, loser to attic |

**Merge uses standard issue merge rules:**

- `updated_at` determines winner for scalar fields

- Labels use union (both additions preserved)

- Description/notes use LWW with attic preservation

**Example re-import scenario:**

```
Time 0: Import bd-a1b2 → is-x1y2 (initial import)
Time 1: Agent updates bd-a1b2 in Beads (adds label "urgent")
Time 2: Human updates is-x1y2 in tbd (changes priority to 1)
Time 3: Re-import bd-a1b2

Result: is-x1y2 has both changes:
  - Label "urgent" (from Beads, union merge)
  - Priority 1 (from tbd, more recent updated_at wins)
```

#### 5.1.7 Handling Deletions and Tombstones

> **Scope:** This section specifies tombstone and deletion handling.
> See also: §2.5.3 (Notes on tombstone status), §5.4 (Status Mapping), §5.5 (Migration
> Gotchas).

Beads uses `tombstone` status for soft-deleted issues.
On import:

| Beads Status | tbd Behavior | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tombstone` (first import) | Skip by default | Don’t import deleted issues |
| `tombstone` (re-import) | Set `status: closed`, add label `deleted-in-beads` | Preserve history |

**Options:**

```bash
tbd import beads.jsonl --include-tombstones  # Import tombstones as closed
tbd import beads.jsonl --skip-tombstones     # Skip tombstones (default)
```

#### 5.1.8 Dependency ID Translation

Beads dependencies reference Beads IDs.
On import, these must be translated:

```
Beads: { "type": "blocks", "target": "bd-m5n6" }
tbd: { "type": "blocks", "target": "is-d4e5f6" }  # Looked up from mapping
```

**Algorithm:**

1. Import all issues first (build complete mapping)

2. Second pass: translate dependency target IDs

3. If target not in mapping: log warning, skip dependency (orphan reference)

#### 5.1.9 Import Output

```bash
$ tbd import beads-export.jsonl

Importing from beads-export.jsonl...
  New issues:      23
  Updated:         5
  Unchanged:       142
  Skipped (newer): 2
  Tombstones:      3 (skipped)

Dependency translation:
  Translated: 45
  Orphaned:   1 (bd-z9a0 not found, skipped)

Import complete. Run 'tbd sync' to push changes.
```

**With --dry-run:**

```bash
$ tbd import beads-export.jsonl --dry-run

DRY RUN - no changes will be made

Would import from beads-export.jsonl:
  New issues:      23
    bd-a1b2 → is-??? "Fix authentication bug"
    bd-c3d4 → is-??? "Add OAuth support"
    ...
  Would update:    5
    bd-x7y8 (is-m1n2) - Beads newer by 2 hours
    ...
  Unchanged:       142
  Would skip:      2
    bd-p1q2 (is-g7h8) - tbd newer by 1 day
```

#### 5.1.10 Migration Workflow

**One-step migration (recommended):**

```bash
# In a repo with .beads/ directory - simplest approach
tbd import --from-beads
git add .tbd/
git commit -m "Initialize tbd and import from beads"
tbd sync
```

This auto-initializes tbd and imports all issues in a single command.

**Two-step migration (explicit file):**

```bash
# In Beads repo
bd export > beads-export.jsonl

# In target repo (may be same repo)
tbd init
tbd import beads-export.jsonl
git add .tbd/
git commit -m "Initialize tbd and import from beads"
tbd sync
```

**Ongoing sync (transition period):**

```bash
# If agents are still using Beads occasionally
bd export > beads-export.jsonl
tbd import beads-export.jsonl  # Safe to re-run

# After import, tbd is authoritative
# New work should use tbd commands
```

**Recovery (accidental Beads usage):**

```bash
# Agent accidentally used Beads commands
# Recover that work into tbd
bd export > beads-export.jsonl
tbd import beads-export.jsonl
tbd sync
# Agent's work is now in tbd
```

### 5.3 Field Mapping

| Beads Field | tbd Field | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `id` | New format: `is-xxxx` vs `bd-xxxx` |
| `title` | `title` | Identical |
| `description` | `description` | Identical |
| `type` | `kind` | Renamed for clarity (`type` = entity discriminator) |
| `status` | `status` | See status mapping below |
| `priority` | `priority` | Identical (0-4) |
| `assignee` | `assignee` | Identical |
| `labels` | `labels` | Identical |
| `dependencies` | `dependencies` | Only “blocks” type currently |
| `created_at` | `created_at` | Identical |
| `updated_at` | `updated_at` | Identical |
| `closed_at` | `closed_at` | Identical |
| `due` | `due_date` | Renamed |
| `defer` | `deferred_until` | Renamed |
| `parent` | `parent_id` | Renamed |
| *(implicit)* | `version` | New: conflict resolution |
| *(implicit)* | `type` | New: entity discriminator ("is") |

### 5.4 Status Mapping

| Beads Status | tbd Status | Migration Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `open` | `open` | Direct mapping |
| `in_progress` | `in_progress` | Direct mapping |
| `blocked` | `blocked` | Direct mapping |
| `deferred` | `deferred` | Direct mapping |
| `closed` | `closed` | Direct mapping |
| `tombstone` | *(deleted)* | Skip on import or move to attic |

**Tombstone handling:**

Beads uses `tombstone` for soft-deleted issues.
tbd options:

1. **Skip on import**: Don’t import tombstoned issues (default)

2. **Import as closed**: Convert to `closed` with label `tombstone`

3. **Import to attic**: Store in `.tbd/data-sync/attic/deleted/`

### 5.5 Compatibility Notes

#### What Works Identically

- Issue creation and updates

- Label management

- Dependency tracking (`blocks` type)

- Priority and status workflows

- Filtering and queries

- `ready` command logic

#### Key Differences

**Storage format:**

- Beads: Single `issues.jsonl` file

- tbd: File-per-issue in `.tbd/data-sync/issues/`

**Database:**

- Beads: SQLite cache

- tbd: Optional index, rebuildable from files

**Daemon:**

- Beads: Required background daemon

- tbd: No daemon (optional background sync planned)

**Git integration:**

- Beads: Complex worktree setup

- tbd: Simple sync branch

**Conflict handling:**

- Beads: JSONL merge conflicts

- tbd: Field-level merge with attic

**ID format:**

- Beads: `bd-xxxx` (4-6 hex chars, random)

- tbd: Dual ID system
  - Internal: `is-{ulid}` (26 chars, time-sortable)
  - External: `{prefix}-{short}` (4-5 base36 chars, e.g., `bd-a7k2`)
  - Display prefix configurable via `display.id_prefix` config

### 5.6 Compatibility Contract

This section defines the stability guarantees for scripts and tooling that depend on tbd
CLI output.

**Stable (will not change without major version bump):**

- JSON output schema from `--json` flag (additive changes only)

- Exit codes: 0 = success, 1 = error, 2 = usage error, 3 = no matching change, 130 =
  SIGINT (§4.10)

- Change report schema from `tbd changes` and `tbd watch` (§4.14.3), under the same
  additive-only rule as other JSON output

- Initialization error: Commands in uninitialized repos exit with code 1 and message
  `Error: Not a tbd repository (run 'tbd init' or 'tbd import --from-beads' first)`

- Command names and primary flags listed in this spec

- External ID format: `{prefix}-{4-5 base36 chars}` (e.g., `proj-a7k2`)

- Internal ID format: `is-{26 char ulid}` (e.g., `is-01hx5zzkbkactav9wevgemmvrz`)

**Stable with deprecation warnings:**

- Flag aliases (e.g., `--db` → `--dir`)

- Field renames in JSON output (old name continues to work)

**Not guaranteed stable:**

- Human-readable output formatting (column widths, colors, wording)

- Error message text

- Timing of sync operations

- Internal file formats (index.json structure)

**Beads compatibility aliases:**

These flags/behaviors are maintained for Beads script compatibility:

- `--db <path>` → `--dir <path>`

- `--type <kind>` → maps to `kind` field (not `type`)

- Display prefix (e.g., `proj-`) set via `display.id_prefix` during init or import

#### Migration Gotchas

1. **IDs are preserved**: Beads `tbd-100` becomes `bd-100` (same short ID!)
   - Internal ID is ULID-based: `is-01hx5zzkbk...`
   - Short ID is preserved: `100`
   - Set `display.id_prefix: tbd` to keep exact same display format
   - Commit messages and documentation references remain valid

2. **No daemon**: Background sync must be manual or cron-based

3. **No auto-flush**: Beads auto-syncs on write
   - tbd publishes issues on `tbd sync` (per-command auto-sync is not currently enabled)

4. **Tombstone issues**: Decide import behavior (skip/convert/attic)

* * *

## 6. Implementation Notes

### 6.1 Performance Optimization

#### Query Index

> **Note:** This optional caching layer is not currently implemented.
> The current implementation scans issue files directly on each query.

**Optional caching layer** (potential future feature):

```typescript
// JSON-serializable index structure
interface Index {
  // Main issue lookup (object, not Map)
  issues: { [id: string]: IssueSummary };

  // Secondary indexes (arrays, not Sets)
  by_status: { [status: string]: string[] };
  by_assignee: { [assignee: string]: string[] };
  by_label: { [label: string]: string[] };

  // Freshness tracking
  last_updated: string; // ISO8601 timestamp
  baseline_commit: string; // Git commit hash this index was built from
}
```

> **Note:** Index uses plain objects and arrays (JSON-serializable), not Map/Set.
> Arrays are kept sorted for deterministic serialization.

**Checksum strategy:**

The index freshness is determined by comparing `baseline_commit` to the current
`tbd-sync` branch HEAD:

```bash
# Check if index is fresh
CURRENT=$(git rev-parse tbd-sync)
if [ "$CURRENT" == "$INDEX_BASELINE_COMMIT" ]; then
  # Index is fresh, use it
else
  # Index is stale, rebuild or incrementally update
  git diff --name-only $INDEX_BASELINE_COMMIT..$CURRENT
fi
```

**Rebuild strategy:**

1. Check if index exists and baseline_commit matches current sync branch HEAD

2. If stale, incrementally update by processing only changed files (via git diff)

3. If no index or baseline missing, full rebuild from all issue files

4. Store index in a local file (gitignored, never synced)

**Performance targets:**

- Cold start (no index): <500ms for 5,000 issues

- Warm start (index hit): <50ms for common queries

- Index rebuild: <1s for 10,000 issues

- Incremental update: <100ms for typical sync (10-50 changed files)

**Incremental operations:** Common operations like `tbd list`, `tbd ready`, and
`tbd sync --status` use the index and diff-based updates to meet performance targets
even at scale.

#### File I/O Optimization

- Batch reads when possible

- Atomic writes: temp file + rename

- Lazy loading: only parse JSON when needed

- Streaming for large operations

### 6.2 Testing Strategy

**Unit tests:**

- Schema validation (Zod)

- Merge algorithm

- ID generation

- Timestamp handling

**Integration tests:**

- CLI command parsing

- File I/O

- Git operations

- Sync algorithm

**End-to-end tests:**

- Full workflows (create → update → sync → close)

- Multi-machine sync scenarios

- Conflict resolution

- Beads import

**Platform tests:**

- macOS, Linux, Windows

- Network filesystems (NFS, SMB)

- Cloud environments (simulated)

### 6.3 Migration Path

**Beads → tbd migration workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Final Beads sync (stop daemon first)
bd sync

# 2. Import issues to tbd (auto-initializes if needed)
tbd import --from-beads --verbose

# 3. Disable Beads (moves files to .beads-disabled/)
tbd setup beads --disable               # Preview what will be moved
tbd setup beads --disable --confirm     # Actually disable

# 4. Install tbd integrations
tbd setup claude                        # Claude Code hooks
tbd setup codex                         # AGENTS.md (for Codex, Cursor, etc.)

# 5. Verify and commit
tbd stats
git add .tbd/ && git commit -m "Migrate from Beads to tbd"
git push origin tbd-sync
```

**What `tbd setup beads --disable` does:**

The command safely moves all Beads files to `.beads-disabled/` for potential rollback:

| Source | Destination | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.beads/` | `.beads-disabled/.beads/` | Beads data and config |
| `.beads-hooks/` | `.beads-disabled/.beads-hooks/` | Beads git hooks |
| `.cursor/rules/beads.mdc` | `.beads-disabled/.cursor/rules/beads.mdc` | Cursor rules |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | `.beads-disabled/.claude/settings.local.json` | Backup (bd hooks removed) |
| `AGENTS.md` | `.beads-disabled/AGENTS.md` | Backup (Beads section removed) |
| `.gitattributes` | `.beads-disabled/.gitattributes` | Backup (beads merge driver lines removed) |

To restore Beads, move files back from `.beads-disabled/`.

**Gradual rollout alternative:**

- Keep Beads running alongside tbd initially (don’t run `tbd setup beads --disable`)

- Compare outputs (`bd list` vs `tbd list`)

- Migrate one team/agent at a time

- Run `tbd setup beads --disable --confirm` for full cutover when confident

### 6.4 Installation and Agent Integration

tbd is distributed as an npm package (`get-tbd`), enabling simple installation across
all environments including cloud sandboxes.

#### 6.4.1 Installation Methods

| Method | Command | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **npm** (primary) | `npm install -g get-tbd` | Most users, cloud environments |
| **npx** (no install) | `npx get-tbd <command>` | One-off usage, testing |
| **From source** | `pnpm install && pnpm build` | Contributors |

**npm is the recommended approach** because:

- Works in all environments (local, CI, Claude Code Cloud)
- Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Version management via package.json
- No compilation required

#### 6.4.2 Claude Code Integration

Claude Code hooks are always installed to the **project-local** `.claude/` directory,
adjacent to `.git/` and `.tbd/` at the git repository root.
There is no global/user-level installation—this avoids confusion and ensures hooks work
in any environment (local dev, Claude Code Cloud, etc.).

**A. JSON Settings Hooks** (installed to `.claude/settings.json` at project root)

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash .claude/scripts/tbd-session.sh" }]
      }
    ],
    "PreCompact": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash .claude/scripts/tbd-session.sh --brief" }]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/tbd-closing-reminder.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **SessionStart**: Ensures tbd is installed, then runs `tbd prime` for workflow context
- **PreCompact**: Runs `tbd prime --brief` before context compaction
- **PostToolUse**: Reminds about `tbd sync` after `git push`

All hook commands use project-relative paths (e.g.,
`bash .claude/scripts/tbd-session.sh`) so they work regardless of where tbd was
installed globally.

**B. Session Script** (installed to `.claude/scripts/tbd-session.sh`)

The session script handles tbd CLI installation (if missing) and runs `tbd prime`. It is
committed to the repo so cloud environments bootstrap automatically.
It contains no tbd release literal: it uses an installed CLI when that CLI can read the
repository’s `tbd_format`, otherwise it invokes the strictly validated exact
`tbd_fallback_version` stored once in `.tbd/config.yml`. Compatible package upgrades
therefore update the central pin without rewriting the script.

**Setup command:**

```bash
tbd setup --auto --prefix=myapp   # Fresh project: initialize + configure hooks
tbd setup --auto                  # Existing project: update hooks and skill files
```

Setup requires a git repository.
Running `tbd setup` outside a git repo produces an error.
When run from a subdirectory, setup resolves to the git root so `.tbd/` and `.claude/`
are always placed adjacent to `.git/`.

#### 6.4.3 The `tbd prime` Command

The `tbd prime` command outputs workflow context for AI agents.
It’s designed to be called by hooks at session start and before context compaction to
ensure agents remember the tbd workflow.

```bash
tbd prime [options]

Options:
  --export        Output default content (ignores PRIME.md override)
```

**Behavior:**

- **Silent exit** (code 0, no stderr) if not in a tbd project
- **Custom override**: Users can place `.tbd/PRIME.md` to fully customize output

**Output** (~1-2k tokens): the session-close protocol, core bead-tracking rules, the
essential command reference (including the bulk multi-ID forms of `close`/`reopen`/
`update` and the never-shell-loop rule), and common workflows.
The content is composed from one source — the skill baseline
(`shortcuts/system/skill-baseline.md`, see `tbd-prime.md` for the rendered form) — so
this document does not duplicate it; regenerate rather than hand-edit.

**Custom Override:**

Users can place a `.tbd/PRIME.md` file to fully customize the output.
When this file exists, `tbd prime` outputs its contents instead of the default.
Use `--export` to see the default content for customization:

```bash
# Export default content to customize
tbd prime --export > .tbd/PRIME.md
# Edit .tbd/PRIME.md to add project-specific instructions
```

**Key design principle:** Global hooks + project-aware logic.
The hooks run on every session, but `tbd prime` only outputs context when `.tbd/`
exists. This creates a “just works” experience without breaking non-tbd projects.

#### 6.4.4 Other Editor Integrations

**Cursor IDE and AGENTS.md-compatible tools:**

Cursor (v1.6+) and other AGENTS.md-compatible tools read the `AGENTS.md` file
automatically. Run `tbd setup codex` to create/update AGENTS.md with tbd instructions.

**Generic (any editor):**

For editors without specific integration, add to your project’s `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Issue Tracking

This project uses tbd for issue tracking:

- Find work: `tbd ready`
- Create issues: `tbd create "title" --type=task`
- Claim work: `tbd update <id> --status=in_progress`
- Complete: `tbd close <id>`
- Sync: `tbd sync`
```

#### 6.4.5 Cloud Environment Bootstrapping

For fresh cloud environments (Claude Code Cloud, GitHub Codespaces, etc.), commit the
bootstrap script to your repository:

```bash
# .claude/hooks/session-start.sh
#!/bin/bash
command -v tbd &>/dev/null || npm install -g get-tbd --quiet
[ -d ".tbd" ] && tbd prime
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x .claude/hooks/session-start.sh
git add .claude/hooks/session-start.sh
git commit -m "Add tbd bootstrap for cloud environments"
```

### 7.1 Design Decisions

#### Decision 1: File-per-entity vs JSONL

**Choice**: File-per-entity

**Rationale**:

- Parallel creation has zero conflicts (vs JSONL merge conflicts)

- Git diffs are readable

- Atomic updates per issue

- Scales better (no need to read entire file for one issue)

**Tradeoffs**:

- More inodes (not a problem on modern filesystems)

- Slightly more disk space (negligible)

#### Decision 2: No daemon required

**Choice**: Optional daemon, not required

**Rationale**:

- Simpler architecture

- Fewer failure modes

- Works in restricted environments (CI, cloud sandboxes)

- Manual sync is predictable

**Tradeoffs**:

- No automatic background sync

- Users must run `tbd sync` manually or via cron

#### Decision 3: Sync branch instead of main

**Choice**: Dedicated `tbd-sync` branch

**Rationale**:

- No merge conflicts on feature branches

- Clean separation of concerns

- Easy to allow-list in sandboxed environments

- Issues shared across all code branches

**Tradeoffs**:

- Slightly more complex git setup

- Users must understand two branches

#### Decision 4: Dual ID system (ULID and short base36)

**Choice**: Internal IDs use ULID (`is-{ulid}`), external IDs use short base36
(`{prefix}-{short}`)

**Rationale**:

- **Time-ordered sorting**: ULIDs sort chronologically, useful for debugging and
  listings
- **No collisions**: ULID’s 80-bit randomness eliminates collision retry logic
- **Cross-project merging**: Multiple projects can merge their issues without internal
  ID collisions (external IDs may need different prefixes)
- **Human-friendly**: Short base36 IDs (4-5 chars) are easy to type and remember
- **Permanent references**: External IDs are stable for docs, commits, external systems
- **Beads compatibility**: Configurable display prefix (`bd-`) for migration

**Tradeoffs**:

- Two ID formats to understand (internal vs external)
- Mapping file adds small complexity
- Longer internal IDs in file paths

**Mitigations**:

- Users only interact with short external IDs
- Mapping file syncs automatically
- ULID sorting benefits outweigh longer paths

#### Decision 5: Only “blocks” dependencies

**Choice**: Support only `blocks` dependency type

**Rationale**:

- Simpler implementation

- Matches Beads’ primary use case (`ready` command)

- Can add more types later without breaking changes

**Tradeoffs**:

- Can’t express “related” or “discovered-from” relationships yet

#### Decision 6: Markdown and YAML storage

**Choice**: Markdown + YAML front matter for issue storage

**Context**: [ticket](https://github.com/wedow/ticket), TrackDown, and other tools
successfully use Markdown + YAML frontmatter.
We adopt this approach.

**Prior art**:

- ticket (~1400 GitHub stars): YAML front matter + Markdown body

- TrackDown: Markdown files with structured headers

- Hugo/Jekyll: Mature tooling for YAML front matter parsing

- git-issue: Pure text format for issue tracking

**Rationale for Markdown + YAML**:

- **Human-readable**: Issues readable/editable without special tools

- **IDE integration**: Native Markdown support in all editors

- **Search integration**: ripgrep/grep work directly on issue files

- **AI-friendly**: Agents can search without parsing bloat

- **Long-form descriptions**: Rich formatting (headings, lists, code blocks)

- **Familiar format**: Developers already know Markdown + YAML

**Structured Data Handling**:

- YAML front matter contains all schema fields (structured data)

- Markdown body contains `description` and optional `## Notes` section

- Canonical serialization ensures deterministic hashing

- Schema validation via Zod after parsing

**Tradeoffs**:

- Parsing slightly more complex than JSON

- Requires YAML + Markdown parsers (vs JSON only)

- Multi-line fields need careful YAML escaping

**Mitigations**:

- Use gray-matter for front-matter delimiters and the `yaml` package for all YAML
  parsing and serialization, behind one wrapper that rejects non-YAML language markers
  before gray-matter can select its built-in JavaScript evaluator

- Canonical serialization rules ensure consistency

- Attic entries use pure YAML (no Markdown body needed)

#### Decision 7: Hidden worktree for sync branch

**Choice**: Use a hidden git worktree for sync branch access

**Context**: tbd stores issues on a sync branch (`tbd-sync`) that’s separate from the
user’s working branch.
We need a way to access and search sync branch content without affecting the user’s
checkout.

**Alternatives Considered**:

1. **Isolated index (`GIT_INDEX_FILE`)**: Use git plumbing with isolated index
   - Pro: Minimal disk usage, no extra checkout

   - Con: Files not accessible to ripgrep/grep for searching

2. **Sparse checkout**: Checkout only `.tbd/data-sync/` directory
   - Pro: Files accessible, minimal overhead

   - Con: Pollutes user’s working directory, shows in `git status`

3. **Hidden worktree**: Separate checkout at `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/data-sync-worktree/`
   - Pro: Files accessible for search, isolated from user’s work

   - Con: Additional disk space for second checkout

**Rationale for Hidden Worktree**:

- **Search integration**: ripgrep/grep work directly on issue files

- **User isolation**: Hidden in Git’s common directory, doesn’t pollute any checkout

- **Git-native**: Uses standard `git worktree` mechanics

- **Clean status**: Lives under `.git`, doesn’t appear in user’s `git status`

**Implementation Notes**:

- Worktree created at `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/tbd/data-sync-worktree/`

- Worktree directory added to `.tbd/.gitignore`

- `tbd init` creates worktree automatically

- Worktree kept in sync via `tbd sync` commands

- **No silent fallback**: If worktree is missing, commands error with repair
  instructions (see §2.3.5 Path Terminology and Resolution)

**Tradeoffs**:

- Additional disk space (~2x issue storage)

- Worktree must be kept in sync

- Edge case: stale worktree if not synced recently

- Edge case: worktree can become “prunable” if directory deleted outside of git

**Mitigations**:

- Search commands auto-refresh if worktree is stale

- `tbd doctor` detects and repairs worktree issues (see §4.9)

- `tbd sync --fix` repairs worktree before syncing

- Space overhead is minimal (issues are small files)

- Clear error messages guide users to repair commands

### 7.2 Future Enhancements

#### Additional Dependency Types (High Priority)

Currently only `blocks` dependencies are supported.
Future versions should add:

**`related`**: Link related issues without blocking semantics

- Use case: “See also” references, grouping related work

- No effect on `ready` command

**`discovered-from`**: Track issue provenance

- Use case: When working on issue A, agent discovers issue B

- Pattern: `tbd create "Found bug" --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`

- Common in Beads workflows for linking discovered work to parent issues

**Implementation**: Extend `Dependency.type` enum, update CLI `--deps` parsing.
No changes to sync algorithm needed.

#### Ripgrep-Based Search (Performance)

Currently search loads all issues into memory and filters with JavaScript string
matching. For large repositories (10K+ issues), this could be optimized:

**Approach:**

1. If `rg` (ripgrep) is available, use it for initial pattern matching
2. Fall back to `grep -r` if ripgrep unavailable
3. Emit warning on first fallback: “ripgrep not found, using grep (slower)”

**Benefits:**

- Faster initial pattern matching (ripgrep is highly optimized)
- Lower memory usage (don’t load all issues upfront)
- Context lines support (`-C` flag)
- External commands visible in `--verbose` mode for debugging

**Implementation:**

```bash
rg -i -C 2 --type md "pattern" "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)/tbd/data-sync-worktree/.tbd/data-sync/issues/"
```

Post-process results to:

- Map file paths to issue IDs
- Apply field filters (title, description, notes)
- Apply status/type/label filters by reading matched files

#### Agent Registry

**Entities**: `agents/` collection on sync branch

**Use cases**:

- Track which agents are working on what

- Agent capabilities and metadata

- Heartbeats and presence (ephemeral)

#### Comments/Messages

**Entities**: `messages/` collection on sync branch

**Use cases**:

- Comments on issues

- Agent-to-agent messaging

- Threaded discussions

#### GitHub Bridge

**Architecture**:

- Optional bridge process

- Webhook-driven sync

- Outbox/inbox pattern

- Rate limit aware

**Use cases**:

- Mirror issues to GitHub for visibility

- Sync comments bidirectionally

- Trigger workflows on issue changes

#### Real-time Coordination

Poll-based coordination already exists: `tbd watch` (§4.14) wakes a process when
selected committed bead state changes on the remote, at remote-poll latency and with no
daemon. What it does not provide:

**Components**:

- Presence service (which agents are live right now)

- Atomic claim leases, so two agents cannot claim one bead

- Push delivery rather than polling

**Use cases**:

- Sub-second coordination

- Multiple agents on same codebase

- Distributed teams

#### Workflow Automation

**Entities**: `workflows/` collection

**Use cases**:

- Multi-step procedures

- State machines

- Triggers and actions

#### Time Tracking

**Fields**: `time_estimate`, `time_spent`

**Use cases**:

- Effort estimation

- Sprint planning

- Agent performance metrics

## Appendix A: Beads to tbd Feature Mapping

This appendix provides a comprehensive mapping between Beads and tbd for migration
planning and compatibility reference.

### A.1 Executive Summary

tbd provides CLI-level compatibility with Beads for core issue tracking while
simplifying the architecture:

| Aspect | Beads | tbd |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data locations | 4 (SQLite, local JSONL, sync branch, main) | 2 (files on sync branch, config on main) |
| Storage | SQLite + JSONL | Markdown + YAML (file-per-entity) |
| Daemon | Required (recommended) | Not required |
| Agent coordination | External daemon | `tbd watch` wake-ups; atomic claims deferred |
| Comments | Embedded in issue | Deferred |
| Conflict resolution | 3-way merge | Git-based detection + field-level LWW + attic |

**Core finding:** All essential Beads issue-tracking workflows have direct CLI
equivalents in tbd. Advanced features (atomic claims, workflow templates, real-time
messaging) are explicitly deferred.

| *(implicit)* | `version` | ✅ | New: conflict resolution |
| *(implicit)* | `type` | ✅ | New: entity discriminator ("is") |
| `comments` | *(future)* | ⏳ | Separate messages entity |

#### A.3.2 Status Values

| Beads Status | tbd Status | Migration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `open` | `open` | ✅ Direct |
| `in_progress` | `in_progress` | ✅ Direct |
| `blocked` | `blocked` | ✅ Direct |
| `deferred` | `deferred` | ✅ Direct |
| `closed` | `closed` | ✅ Direct |
| `tombstone` | *(deleted)* | ✅ Skip or move to attic |
| `pinned` | *(label)* | ✅ Convert to label on import |
| `hooked` | *(label)* | ✅ Convert to label on import |

#### A.3.3 Issue Types/Kinds

| Beads Type | tbd Kind | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bug` | `bug` | ✅ |
| `feature` | `feature` | ✅ |
| `task` | `task` | ✅ |
| `epic` | `epic` | ✅ |
| `chore` | `chore` | ✅ |
| `message` | *(future)* | ⏳ Separate entity |
| `agent` | *(future)* | ⏳ Separate entity |

#### A.3.4 Dependency Types

> **See also:** [§2.7 Relationship Types](#27-relationship-types) for detailed
> documentation of tbd’s relationship model, including rationale for differences from
> Beads.

| Beads Type | tbd Type | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `blocks` | `blocks` | ✅ Supported | Identical semantics |
| `related` | `related` | ⏳ Future | Non-blocking soft links |
| `discovered-from` | `discovered-from` | ⏳ Future | Provenance tracking |
| `parent-child` | `parent_id` field | ✅ Different model | See below |

**Parent-child model difference:**

- **Beads**: `parent-child` enables **transitive blocking**—if a parent is blocked (by a
  `blocks` dependency), children inherit that blockage.
  Children are NOT blocked just because their parent is open.
  (See `attic/beads/internal/storage/sqlite/blocked_cache.go` for implementation
  details.)
- **tbd**: `parent_id` is a separate field for **organizational hierarchy only** (no
  blocking effects, no transitive propagation)

This is intentional—tbd’s simpler model avoids hidden transitive effects while still
allowing organizational hierarchy.
See [§2.7.7](#277-future-transitive-blocking-option) for discussion of adding opt-in
transitive blocking in the future.

### A.4 Architecture Comparison

#### A.4.1 Storage

| Aspect | Beads | tbd |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary store | SQLite | Markdown + YAML files |
| Sync format | JSONL | Markdown + YAML (same as primary) |
| File structure | Single `issues.jsonl` | File per entity |
| Location | `.beads/` on main | `.tbd/data-sync/` on sync branch |
| Config | SQLite + various | `.tbd/config.yml` on main |

#### A.4.2 Sync

| Aspect | Beads | tbd |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mechanism | SQLite ↔ JSONL ↔ git | Files ↔ git |
| Branch | Main or sync branch | Sync branch only |
| Conflict detection | 3-way (base, local, remote) | Git push rejection |
| Conflict resolution | LWW + union | LWW + union (same strategies) |
| Conflict preservation | Partial | Full (attic) |
| Daemon required | Yes (recommended) | No |

### A.5 LLM Agent Workflow Comparison

#### A.5.1 Basic Agent Loop (Full Parity)

**Beads:**

```bash
bd ready --json              # Find work
bd update <id> --status=in_progress  # Claim (advisory)
# ... work ...
bd close <id> --reason "Done"  # Complete
bd sync                       # Sync
```

**tbd:**

```bash
tbd ready --json            # Find work
tbd update <id> --status=in_progress  # Claim (advisory)
# ... work ...
tbd close <id> --reason "Done"  # Complete
tbd sync                    # Sync
```

**Assessment:** ✅ Identical workflow.
Claims are advisory in both (no enforcement).

#### A.5.2 Creating Linked Work (Partial Parity)

**Beads:**

```bash
bd create "Found bug" --type=bug --priority=P1 --deps discovered-from:<id> --json
```

**tbd:**

```bash
# Only blocks dependency supported currently
tbd create "Found bug" --type=bug --priority=P1 --parent=<id> --json
# Or wait for future version for discovered-from
```

**Assessment:** ⚠️ `discovered-from` dependency not yet available.
Use `--parent` or wait for a future version.

#### A.5.3 Migration Workflow

```bash
# Export from Beads
bd export -o beads-export.jsonl

# In target repo
tbd init
tbd import beads-export.jsonl  # Converts format
git add .tbd/
git commit -m "Initialize tbd from beads"
tbd sync

# Configure display prefix for familiarity
tbd config display.id_prefix bd
```

### A.6 Parity Summary

| Category | Parity | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Issue CRUD | ✅ Full | All core operations |
| Labels | ✅ Full | Add, remove, list |
| Dependencies | ⚠️ Partial | Only `blocks` type |
| Sync | ✅ Full | Pull, push, status |
| Maintenance | ✅ Full | Init, doctor, stats, config |
| Import | ✅ Full | Beads JSONL + multi-source |

### A.7 Deferred Features

| Category | Priority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent registry | High | Built-in coordination |
| Comments/Messages | High | Separate entity type |
| `related` deps | Medium | Additional dep type |
| `discovered-from` deps | Medium | Additional dep type |
| Daemon | Medium | Optional background sync |
| GitHub bridge | Low | External integration |
| Templates | Low | Reusable workflows |

### A.8 Migration Compatibility

- **CLI:** 95%+ compatible for core workflows

- **Data:** Full import from Beads JSONL (including multi-source from main + sync
  branch)

- **Display:** Configurable ID prefix (`bd-xxxx` vs `cd-xxxx`)

- **Behavior:** Advisory claims, manual sync (no daemon)

**Overall assessment:** tbd provides sufficient feature parity for LLM agents to migrate
from Beads for basic issue tracking.
The simpler architecture (no SQLite, no daemon, file-per-entity) addresses the key pain
points from real-world Beads use.

| `bd comment add` | Comments entity - future |
| `bd comment list` | Comments entity - future |
| `bd comments show` | Comments entity - future |

### B.6 Editor Integration Commands

| Beads Command | tbd Equivalent | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bd setup claude` | `tbd setup claude` | ✅ Implemented |
| `bd setup cursor` | `tbd setup cursor` | ✅ Implemented |
| `bd setup aider` | *(not implemented)* | Not planned |
| `bd setup factory` | `tbd setup codex` | ✅ Implemented (renamed) |
| `bd edit` | *(not implemented)* | Not planned (use `tbd show` + editor) |

### B.7 Additional Dependency Types

> **See also:** [§2.7 Relationship Types](#27-relationship-types) for tbd’s complete
> relationship model.

Currently only `blocks` is supported.
Based on real-world Beads usage data:

| Beads Type | Usage | tbd Status | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `blocks` | 47% | ✅ Supported | Core workflow dependency |
| `parent-child` | 42% | ✅ Via `parent_id` | Different model (non-blocking) |
| `discovered-from` | 11% | 🔜 Planned | Useful for provenance tracking |
| `related` | <1% | ⏳ Future | Rarely used in practice |
| `waits-for` | — | ⏳ Future | Fanout gates (advanced) |
| `conditional-blocks` | — | ⏳ Future | Error handling (advanced) |

**Note:** In Beads, `parent-child` enables transitive blocking (if parent is blocked,
children inherit that blockage), while tbd’s `parent_id` is purely organizational with
no blocking effects.
See [§2.7.5](#275-comparison-with-beads) for details.

## 8. Open Questions

These items from the design review need further discussion before implementation.
See `tbd-design-v2-phase1-tracking.md` for full context.

### 8.1 Actor System Design

**Status:** Partially designed, not implemented.

The actor system tracks who creates and modifies issues.
Current implementation status:

**Implemented:**

- Schema fields: `created_by` and `assignee` exist in IssueSchema
- CLI option: `--assignee` can be set when creating/updating issues
- Display: `assignee` shown in list and show commands

**NOT Implemented:**

- `created_by` field is never populated when creating issues
- `--actor` CLI flag does not exist
- `TBD_ACTOR` environment variable not checked
- No git user.email fallback for actor resolution
- No system username fallback

**Design Questions:**

1. **Actor vs Assignee distinction:**
   - `created_by`: Who created the issue (tracked automatically)
   - `assignee`: Who is working on it (set explicitly)
   - Should these always use the same resolution?

2. **Multi-agent workflows:**
   - Should agents be assigned random ULID-based actor IDs?
   - How should agents claim/release issues?
   - Is advisory claiming sufficient or do we need atomic claims?

3. **Actor resolution order:**
   - Design doc specifies: `--actor` > `TBD_ACTOR` > git user.email > username+hostname
   - Is this order correct?
     Should git user.name be considered?

4. **Sync commit authorship:**
   - Should sync commits use the actor name?
   - How does this interact with git commit signing?

**Recommendation:** Defer full implementation until multi-agent coordination patterns
are better understood.
Current fallback to git user.email is sufficient for single-user and simple multi-agent
scenarios.

### 8.2 Git Operations

**V2-004: Remote vs local branch reference ambiguity**

After `git fetch origin tbd-sync`, should reads use `origin/tbd-sync` (remote tracking)
or local `tbd-sync`? Current spec uses `tbd-sync:` in examples, which may read stale
data if not updated after fetch.

**Options:**

1. Always read from `origin/tbd-sync` after fetch

2. Update local `tbd-sync` ref after fetch, then read from it

3. Document both patterns with guidance on when to use each

This is settled for read-only observation, which takes a fourth option: `tbd watch`
fetches into a private ref and reads that, leaving both `tbd-sync` and `origin/tbd-sync`
untouched (§3.7). The question remains open for sync itself.

### 8.2 Timestamp and Ordering

**V2-012: Clock skew assumptions**

LWW merge relies on `updated_at` timestamps.
Clock skew between machines can cause counterintuitive winners.
The attic preserves losers, but UX may suffer if the “wrong” version consistently wins.

**Options:**

1. Add a note acknowledging the limitation, rely on attic for recovery

2. Implement Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC) in the future

3. Add optional “prefer remote” or “prefer local” config override

### 8.3 Mapping File Structure

**V2-016: Single mapping file as potential conflict hotspot**

**RESOLVED**: The unified `.tbd/data-sync/mappings/ids.yml` file handles all short ID
mappings (both imported and newly created).
Conflicts are resolved via union merge—since short IDs are unique, adding new mappings
never conflicts with existing ones.

Concurrent imports with the same source would produce identical mappings (idempotent).
Concurrent imports from different sources have distinct short IDs (no conflict).

**Additional protection** (added in response to
[#99](https://github.com/jlevy/tbd/issues/99)): `.tbd/.gitattributes` configures
`merge=union` for all `ids.yml` files, preventing git from deleting rows during merge.
The sync code also includes `reconcileMappings()` which detects missing mappings after
merge and recovers original short IDs from git history before falling back to new random
IDs. The `doctor --fix` command provides a manual recovery path.
Together these provide three layers of defense: prevention (`.gitattributes`), detection
and recovery (reconcileMappings), and manual repair (doctor).

### 8.4 ID Length

**RESOLVED**: Adopted ULID-based internal IDs.

Internal IDs now use full 26-character ULIDs (128 bits: 48-bit timestamp + 80-bit
randomness). This provides:

- Effectively unlimited ID space (no collision concerns even across merged projects)
- Time-ordered sorting as a bonus
- Human interaction uses short 4-5 character base36 external IDs

The original concern about 6-hex-char limitations is moot with the dual ID system.

### 8.5 Future Extension Points

**Idea 7: Reserve directory structure for future bridges**

Should we reserve `.tbd/outbox/` and `.tbd/inbox/` directories for future bridge runtime
use?

**Options:**

1. Reserve now (empty dirs, documented for future use)

2. Add when needed (avoid premature structure)

> **Note:** The cache/ directory has been removed.
> Any future local state should use `.tbd/` directly with appropriate gitignore entries.

### 8.6 Issue Storage Location

**Hybrid sync branch vs main branch storage**

The current design stores all issues on the `tbd-sync` branch, keeping main branch
clean. However, there may be use cases where some issues should live on the main branch
(e.g., for visibility in PRs, code review context) while others remain on the sync
branch.

**Possible configurations:**

1. **All sync branch** (current design): All issues on `tbd-sync`, main branch stays
   clean. Simplest model, no reconciliation needed.

2. **All main branch**: Issues stored in `.tbd` and/or other folders on main or
   development branches, tracked with code.
   Simpler git model but adds more noise to commit history and creates merge
   complexities.

3. **Status-based split**: Active issues (open, in_progress) on main or development
   branches for visibility; closed/archived issues moved to sync branch automatically.
   tbd enforces the invariant.
   Challenge: What happens when working on different feature branches?
   Need to think through sync behavior.

4. **Gitignored working copies**: Sync branch remains authoritative and complete.
   Allow gitignored copies in a working directory (e.g., `.tbd/local/`) for convenient
   reading and editing.
   A `tbd save` command would push edits from the gitignored copy to the sync branch.
   This avoids reconciliation since sync branch is always the source of truth.

**Considerations:**

- Reconciliation complexity: Having issues in multiple locations creates sync challenges
  (the pain point that motivated moving away from Beads’ 4-location model)

- Branch-specific issues: How do issues get edited and merged on main and feature
  branches? Do they diverge?
  Get merged?

- Visibility vs cleanliness tradeoff: Main branch storage provides GitHub visibility but
  adds noise to diffs and history

**Recommendation:** Defer for now.
The gitignored working copy approach (Option 4) seems promising as it preserves the
single-source-of-truth model while adding convenience.

### 8.7 External Issue Tracker Linking

External trackers use one provider-generic command group and adapter interface.
Linear is the first implementation; GitHub issues are the next.
A repository opts in through `integrations` config.
With no enabled provider, the registry, doctor check, and ordinary `tbd sync` path
remain inert and make no provider request.

Each bead has at most one issue link per provider under the existing opaque namespace:

```yaml
extensions:
  linear:
    id: 7202337e-d1ee-4192-bb6c-c6ae42b97469 # stable provider identity
    key: TBD-3 # display only; may change
    url: https://linear.app/example/issue/TBD-3/example
    linked_at: 2026-08-10T19:34:32.065Z
```

The bead side needs no schema change or format bump: `extensions` is an existing field
whose contents are opaque, so older tbd versions round-trip a link untouched.
The **config** side is the opposite and is why the repository format is `f07`.
`integrations` is a new top-level config key, and every tbd released before 0.6.0 parses
config in strip mode, so it silently drops the block the first time it rewrites
`config.yml`—observed three times during the pilot.
Those clients cannot be fixed retroactively, so f07 makes them fail closed with the
upgrade message instead.
From f07 on, `ConfigSchema` and the `integrations` block preserve unknown keys, so a
later additive config key needs no further bump.
`tbd doctor` reports a block that is committed but missing locally, which is the exact
signature of a pre-f07 client having stripped it.
The persisted payload is an allow-list; credentials, raw API responses, emails, and
workspace metadata never enter a bead.
Different extension namespaces merge independently.
A namespace deletion is an edit, so unlink is not silently resurrected by a concurrent
merge. Within a provider namespace, link writes replace only the allow-listed link keys
and preserve already-durable siblings such as comments or future additive provider
state. The writer never spreads new fields from a link input, so sibling preservation
does not weaken the credential/raw-payload boundary.

`TrackerAdapter` maps every provider into canonical tbd fields.
Each canonicalized issue may carry safe mapping warnings.
The sync engine deduplicates them by provider id and message and exposes them in human
and JSON reports; for example, an unknown Linear workflow-state type maps conservatively
to `open` while remaining visible instead of aborting or silently fabricating a status.
`integration sync --push` is the one-way projection.
`sync` uses a per-link base record on the sync branch for true field-wise three-way
reconciliation. Write-ahead intents are committed before provider writes and replayed
idempotently after a crash.
Description projection has one authoritative writer delimiter pair in
`core/managed-block.ts`: `⟦tbd⟧` and `⟦/tbd⟧`. These visible plain-text delimiters have
no Markdown or HTML semantics.
Readers also accept the former HTML-comment pair; the next outbound splice migrates it
without changing human prose around the managed region or registering a remote
description edit. Full sync renders the block from the reconciled canonical values, so a
pulled or conflict-winning field and its provider-visible summary cannot diverge for one
cycle. A bead-prose push writes the prose first and appends the managed region in a
separate splice, so a region placed in the middle of a provider description moves to the
end; delimiter-only refreshes preserve its position.
Mixed, incomplete, reversed, or duplicate markers fail closed and leave the provider
description untouched.
Every intent operation carries its owning bead id.
Replay performs provider I/O only while that bead still names the operation’s exact
provider id; a user comment must also retain the exact unpushed local entry.
A create’s client UUID is its future provider id, so sync commits it as a provisional
bead link with the journal before provider I/O. A pre-commit crash made no provider
write; a post-commit crash has the durable claim needed for safe replay.
The matching durable create intent makes liveness distinguish two cases: an item that
already exists is fetched and reconciled normally even if follow-up journal work
remains; when the first bridge record does not exist yet, the journaled creation patch
is the three-way base, so a provider edit during that failure window still pulls or
conflicts correctly.
A confirmed absence is pending rather than orphaned—even during pull-only runs that
intentionally defer replay.
Unlink or relink makes an old journal successful cancellation, not work that may touch
the former provider item.
Append-only comments union by immutable identity.
Provider comment connections paginate completely.
Every identity is retained for deduplication, while storage bounds only provider-held
prose (newest 50 entries, 10 KiB per body); pending local prose is never collapsed
before its provider identity lands.
When both sides change a merge-owned field differently, the configured winner is kept,
the loser is archived before either side is overwritten, and the archive path plus a
client-UUID conflict comment are journaled together.
Replay reuses both, making the resolution visible exactly once without ever advertising
a missing archive.

Bare `integration sync` reconciles every linked pair.
Outbound selectors are accepted only with `--push`; using `--bead`, `--type`,
`--status`, `--label`, `--spec`, or `--limit` without it fails as a usage error rather
than silently widening a staged run.
`--pull --external <ref...>` is the explicit inbound selector and bypasses the inbound
policy. `--pull` performs no provider writes, including intent replay; remote attachment
claims and conflict notices are journaled locally for the next full sync.
In every direction, inbound creation persists the bead, bridge record, and attachment
intent before provider I/O; successful full sync removes the intent only after the
idempotent claim upsert lands.
Provider-created hierarchy is imported parent-first.
A child is accepted only when its parent is already linked or belongs to the same import
batch; otherwise it fails closed instead of flattening.
`max_nesting` limits only creation of new outbound projection; inbound and
already-linked items retain their true parent.

Linear `project` configuration scopes both outbound creation and automatic inbound
discovery. Explicit `--pull --external` is identity-directed and intentionally bypasses
that scan scope. Assignee writes are enabled only by a non-empty `user_map`: local beads
persist canonical aliases, configured email/UUID targets resolve at runtime, safely
mapped aliases seed inbound-created beads, and an unknown provider identity freezes that
field with a safe warning until it is mapped.
The bridge retains its prior canonical base during that freeze, so concurrent local
edits remain divergent and recoverable.
Provider display names and emails never cross the persistence boundary.

One external item must never have multiple bead writers.
`link` and inbound creation prevent creating that state with both local reverse indexes
and a provider attachment probe.
An existing `tbd://bead/…` claim refuses the operation unless `--force` is explicit;
this prevents sequential mistakes but is not an atomic cross-repository lock.
Manual link and inbound-create workflows persist the local link/base plus an idempotent
attachment intent before attempting the provider claim; transport failure therefore
replays without creating another bead or another link.
`sync` and `doctor` also detect pre-existing corruption from migrations, imports, or
hand edits: every holder of the duplicated provider id is reported, those pairs are
excluded before intent replay or provider I/O, and unrelated pairs continue.
Recovery is explicit `tbd integration unlink` until one holder remains.
Pending operations for the ambiguous external id are discarded—the durable surviving
bead re-plans current state after repair—so a stale former holder cannot write after
unlink.

Unlink is a cancellation-first transaction under the shared data-sync lock: prune every
pending operation for the bead or external item, clear the bead namespace, then delete
the bridge record last.
A journal read/parse/write failure leaves the link intact and the command retryable.
If execution stops after the bead clears, the bridge record retains the external id for
the retry. Replay provides the independent cross-machine guard: any journal merged later
is consumed without provider I/O because its live link claim is gone.

An absent intent directory means there is nothing to replay.
Any present journal that cannot be read, parsed, or validated fails the sync closed
before provider mutation; silently skipping a create intent would lose its client UUID
and permit duplication.

Plain `tbd sync` runs enabled trackers after git pull/merge and before push, alongside
docs and issues. Surface failures roll up without discarding successful work.
`tbd sync --push` calls the same outbound projection as `tbd integration sync --push`
while holding the data-sync lock, then commits its writes before the git push; it never
invokes inbound reconciliation.
Provider reports with contained item failures and invalid integration config both fail
the tracker surface closed and produce a non-zero aggregate result, while independent
surfaces still complete.
An explicit `integrations.sync_on_tbd_sync: false` keeps a configured tracker manual.
There are no webhooks or background provider polling; remote exchange is always an
ordinary explicit tbd command.

GitHub pull requests have a narrower role than GitHub issues.
Issues implement the full adapter lifecycle.
PRs are read-only implementation associations: tbd may store, show, refresh, link,
unlink, and attach their identity, but it does not rewrite PR title, body, review state,
merge state, or branches.

The live browser remains a viewer.
It may project allow-listed provider keys and URLs, offer shared provider filters, and
navigate to external items; it never holds a credential, calls a provider, edits a link,
or changes sync semantics.
Agents perform link, unlink, explicit inbound selection, outbound projection, and full
sync with the CLI, and the existing local observer publishes those bead changes
immediately.

The full policy, bridge layout, state machine, rollout gates, GitHub work map, and web
projection contract live in
`docs/project/specs/active/plan-2026-08-10-external-tracker-integrations.md`. That plan
contains the authoritative compatibility/evidence matrix.
The provider-independent live scenario contract and completion check live in the
import-safe `scripts/provider-live-qa-contract.ts` module.
Linear supplies the concrete API driver through
`scripts/validate-linear-integration-live.ts`, documented in
`tests/qa/linear-integration.qa.md`; future GitHub validation reuses the same scenario
IDs and adds only provider-specific cases.
